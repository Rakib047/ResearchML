1gaynmv,lthvshm,t3_1gaynmv,TurnaboutFailure,"Hi, I was that kid way back when I was in school.



The thing about depression is that it likes to take every drop of motivation you have and squeeze it out of you like you were a fruit. Often times you don't even get a chance to fight back.



Kid in question might really have been planning to do their part originally, but something or someone might have gotten in the way.


Once the depression kicks in full blast, it's nigh-impossible to do anything no matter how hard you try honestly. I'd sleep several days straight without eating. Nothing would get done. It sucks.


What bothers me in this situation though is... 


Did no one voice their concerns to the teacher/professor? Several months of this behavior is extremely concerning in and of itself. 


I know benefit of the doubt exists (with respects to peer performance), but from now on, I suggest being proactive with educators and letting them know that you have a concern. But absolutely don't paint them (depressed kid) in an overtly negative manner 'cause they really might be in hot shit themselves. Last thing they need is more people to perceive as against them. Which, quite frankly, is everyone and everything while depressed.



If they're out this much, they need help. They need people in their corner and maybe some accomodations to help them be functional in school if taking a gap semester/year isn't possible.


Speaking of which, not everyone can afford to take a gap. Some can't financially (in college/university) without putting them under worse financial pressure. Some can't socially (parents/guardians won't allow it). Some can't personally (self-image/self-esteem issues).


I was always under severe monetary and time pressure by family, sprinkled with constant threats of being kicked onto the streets. 


I couldn't take any gap time... Up until I got caught after a suicide attempt. Then they finally got off my ass.


Mileage may vary.",5,2024-10-24 11:37:58

1gaynmv,ltil6i2,t3_1gaynmv,BeautyIsTheBeast383,"The classmate is a dysfunctional classmate and you’re expecting them to behave like a normal classmate.  For you, the conduct expected is normal rationale, it comes naturally. for him, it doesn’t; he’s not wired that way.  We’re all still responsible for our actions bc our actions affect others.

Talk to the professor about it.

Lacking a gap year, they may be financially dependent on student aid grants/loans or have pressure from family.",4,2024-10-24 14:19:00
1gaynmv,ltjub6l,t3_1gaynmv,Ex_Zpwat,"Honestly, I feel like the only experiences I have with group projects involved at least one of the group members not contributing.

As someone with depression, I'm either insanely productive at work, or I am not productive at all.  And once I fall into the ""not productive at all"" part of the cycle, it's really hard to get out of it.  

If I had to guess, this classmate is in the ""not productive at all"" part of depression and honestly, group projects probably don't offer much motivation to come out of it.  You see, in my group project experience, someone has always stepped up (often me) to make sure everything got done, even if that meant one group member never actually did anything.  A lot of instructors had no interest in hearing which group members contributed and which didn't, so we all got the same grade and at least one group member generally got that grade despite putting in no real effort.  If this has been the experience of your depressed classmate, it's possible they have no drive to participate because they haven't in the past and still got by.  

If this classmate isn't even showing up for classes though, I do think it might be worth it for you or your group as a whole (minus this 1 student) to meet with your instructor and explain what's going on.  It's great if accommodations are or have been made for this classmate but they shouldn't be made at the cost of other students.  

As for taking a gap semester or year, there are a million reasons this might not have happened. As someone else said it could be that they rely on student loans.  Or it could be that they have an awful home life and being away at college is better for them, despite their current struggles.  It could be that they weren't in this place mentally when the semester started and it's taken a toll on them.  Maybe their parents absolutely would not accept that as an option.  Maybe they needed the consistency that came from being in college.  

I can understand why taking a break from college might seem like the obvious answer but after 20+ years of depression, I can tell you this.  If this person is truly dealing with depression, it may be with them for their entire life.  Yes, I think sometimes you have to slow down or take time off if your mental health gets really bad but I think part of having depression is learning how to function in spite of depression and I could see why college would be a good place to start figuring out how to continue functioning even when you're depressed.",1,2024-10-24 18:05:22

Many many times in life we face rejection from the ones we love most. And it's hard, but even if we lose them there will always come others after them. You have experienced that yourself: a second girl came after the first, even though you probably never expected her. 

I guarantee you that a third girl will eventually come. Maybe she will be the one, or maybe you will have to wait for the foruth, the fifth,... but it doesn't matter. What matters is that you do not derive your happiness from those girls loving you back. Because you are a whole person by yourself, someone worthy of respect and love. It's important that you understand this: someone's worth does not come from what others think about them or what merits they can achieve. The fact that you exist makes you instantly valuable, it's just a matter of finding someone capable of seeing that value. And I do believe there are people in our life who see your value right now, but many more will in the future, you are still young.

With saying this,I know how heartbreaking being rejected is, thinking you did everything alright and still failing even though you put so much effort and imagined a different future for how things will go. 

All I can say is,when you change your outlook it geniunely gets better,I am not saying this just insake of saying it. You have to make amends with yourself and understand 1) rejection is a part of this process and 2) neither this feelings nor the 'being rejected' is a forever thing.

I personally hate dating apps as I know I'm a guy, and for men, if you're not an 8 or up white male, your chances of getting 1 swipe is slim to none.

also men dont care about your career. we dont. like if you help kids or animals or are a nurse or something were like ""ah she must be a nice caring person"" but thats it. if you make 100 000 a year we usually dont see any of it so it doesnt matter to us.

in summary there are men who will love you as you are now and there are men who would right you off. you are in the process of working on yourself.

Insist they do the genetic testing so they what is actually going on inside your body. We know a lot more about psychiatry than when most doctors graduated and they just….stopped fucking learning. A lot of people can’t metabolize antidepressants. A lot of people have too little dopamine to be helped by antipsychotics. A lot of people should be diagnosed with autism and adhd instead of depression and anxiety. And a lot of people in psychiatric offices have too much histamine (which causes all sorts of problems) and no one is considering that when they’re prescribing meds.

I don’t 100% know what’s happening in your body, but if i had to guess, I’d say your parasympathetic nervous system is underfunctioning and your sympathetic nervous system is over functioning. 

What that means, in layman’s terms, is that you are perpetually in fight or flight. You probably feel hypervigilant. On edge. Can’t sleep. Things like that. 

This is a very common problem but it’s tough to diagnose because it’s not like a disease. The sympathetic nervous system being on too much doesn’t have a name as far as I’m aware. But you see it with trauma and various other physiological conditions. 

So like, I put this all together because I had gotten to the point where I had gastroparesis (my stomach stopped working) and I stopped making tears. Sex was the last thing on my mind but that barely worked anyway. After LOTS of research and lots of wasting time seeing specialists, i figured out that it wasn’t 7 different body systems with 7 different diseases. These body parts weren’t diseases, they were just following orders from my sympathetic nervous system. 

What the sympathetic nervous system is designed for is to temporarily put you in a state of fight or flight. Like, to help you survive a life and death situation. It temporarily shuts down your non-vital body systems to divert resources to the vital ones. Reproduction is one of them. In a normal, healthy person, your body turns that system off and the parasympathetic back on. You don’t notice your digestion or reproductive system being shut off if the fight or flight only lasts 20 minutes. But you sure notice if it lasts years on end.

I’m willing to bet that some combination of trauma and your physiology is keeping you in the sympathetic dominant state. Your body has likely conditioned itself to stay in fight or flight for too long. The body functions controlled by parasympathetic are offline.

One thing you can do is therapy and other things that activate your parasympathetic nervous system. Do some research. Nature is really high on the list (and there’s science behind it)

The other is vagus nerve stimulation. The vagus nerve controls the parasympathetic nervous system. It’s hard to do, but it can really work. I’ve accidentally stimulated the vagus nerve twice and it was such a dramatic change. Long story, but I felt like I was dying. Then all the sudden, it’s like someone reached in and turned the dial on my emotions. Then within an hour, I had diarrhea. I literally went from no movement in my stomach at all to diarrhea. 

One other additional thing I’ll add is that I just learned in the past day or so that you can stimulate the vagus nerve through rectal stimulation. I cannot guide you on this one so imma tell you to do your own research, but there was a post a couple days ago where these women were swearing by butt plugs for ADHD. I’m not telling you it’ll definitely work, because I have yet to make it to the butt plug store. But their justification was that it stimulates the vagus nerve. 

Soooo….maybe play with a butt plug and see if it helps you with anything. 

This is 100% not a prank. This is a legit post. I’m gonna try the butt plug thing too because I struggle with keeping in parasympathetic mode. But I suspect that this is the source of your issues. Not enough dopamine and sympathetic NS dominance",1,2024-10-24 04:42:18

1gapl41,ltgpwqj,t3_1gapl41,SignificantMaybe7354,"Nothing you say seems faked to me, I completely understand why you would think that, because I felt the same way. But you have to remember, you are not on the edge of becoming a Psychopath. The mere fact that you care about how your family would feel disproves that. 

In 7th grade, I was in a really low place. Whenever I would write about why I thought I felt the way I felt, or try and explain it to others, I would always think it sounded fake too, but it felt as real as anything.

All my life I heard from my parents that I was intelligent. Since I never have had a chance at a social life from acting stupid, (things my brain constantly reminds me of 24/7), I defined myself as being intelligent. Until 7th grade, when my grades went into the shitter. It didn't help that my math teacher would stand me up and dress me down for never doing my homework and getting terrible grades on the tests. When she would go over the HW questions, (we had an online thing) she would always pull up my homework sheet because it would always be empty, and the whole class could see that it was mine. So, what happened to me when the one pillar I stood upon gets ripped from under me feet, well, I invented a new one.

I put on a mask and pretended like nothing bothered me, not any of my peer's talking shit about me while I was in earshot range, then acting like my friend, not my shit grades, not my teachers, nothing. I covered it all up with humor. But under that mask was another mask, this one of how I thought of myself, which was depressed.

I felt as though I was never really in control of my own actions, whether that be in inability to stop making a fool of myself or break another school laptop, and my failure on multiple occasions to go through with suicide, even though it seemed so easy, (I really did want to die in those moments) just reinforced this feeling. Worst of all I could feel my willpower drain as I tried, and when something good or funny eventually happened, every time I laughed, had fun, received praise, the very moment after, my brain would reminded me of my mistakes, and even being happy made me feel guilty, because I viewed myself as depressed, and feeling good made me feel as though I contradicted who I am, and would leave me without definition. I know how stupid that sounds, like I wanted to be depressed, and I agree it does seem that way, but this felt real to me, I wanted to be happy, but I couldn't. I did try and explain how I felt to others, but whenever I did I always ended up feeling that my situation wasn't real, or invalid, and sharing ended in disaster every time, they thought it was ridiculous. But reading that someone else thought they sounded fake was enough for me to share this for the first time, even though I think this probably doesn't sound real or that bad to someone who actually has full on depression.

I'm a sophomore now have pulled my grades back out of the cesspool and can now stand back on the pillar I once did. I am happy for the most part now, but still, sometimes, that mask comes back. To this day ponder why I felt that way. It makes sense to me, but I can't make it make sense to me in words, if that makes any sense at all.

This is the first time I have posed on this subreddit, let along shared this in anything close to this much detail, even as I write this I hesitate pressing the comment button for fear of having said something wrong.",1,2024-10-24 04:39:33

You are going through a stage right now, I mean, it is difficult to deal with but it is temporary, not forever.

Things that can help you get rid of that feeling, for example, you can do things that you like, like writing, playing soccer, basketball, running, whatever you like, do it!

You can write a personal diary where you write your day to day and how you feel and at the end of each day you draw a face depending on your mood so you will see how you have progressed throughout the days,

Remember again as I said before that it is a stage that this is temporary that in 1 year or less you will be very happy surely just look for things that make you happy

You would be more biologically vulnerable to STDs and likely contract Chlamydia multiple times. You would risk pregnancy, which is a whole body horror in and of itself and the entire time men would be fighting to pass laws that would force you to carry that unwanted pregnancy to term AND keep the rotting fetus inside of your body to likely kill you should you experience a miscarriage (which are actually VERY common btw). 

Being seen as a piece of meat to be used to sex and a human factory to be used for reproduction are extremely depressing things to live with as well. You can make more money, you can even get a prenup, women cannot just get a new body.

1gapeye,ltnbg94,t1_ltmy543,Old_Region_9779,"I'll try to elaborate based on what you've written as best I can.

\> I'm tired of of going to work and destroying my body for a paycheck that barely covers the bare minimum

About work, I don't know what you work as, neither what you could work as, but have you tried changing your job? It doesn't seem like it's something you enjoy nor does it pay well. What is the barrier here?

\> being constantly reminded by social media and walking around in the world that I'm disposable, invisible, and only worth what I can provide.

What makes you think people on social media know any better than anyone else? From my experience, everybody believes in something and nobody knows anything. Belief requires ignorance, once you know, you cannot believe. And everyone just believes that life is about this or about that, that means they've made that up. It's just an idea, it's not real. I can believe in whatever I want, that changes nothing in life, in reality.

Hmm, do you know the difference between an idea, a belief, an ideology, a philosophy and reality? The difference is just this, the idea is in your head, reality is experiential, it's actual, you can experience it with your entirety, not just as a thought in your mind.

An example you have made, worth. Worth is an idea, it's not real. Different things have different worth to different people in different societies, because everyone makes up their own worth. Worth is not inherent in anything, it's just an idea. If worth were real, the same things would have the same worth everywhere, but that's just not true. Further, even the worth you make up for yourself is not consistent, forget other people. When you're happy, the worth changes for you, when you're miserable it changes again. That's because it's an idea and your state of mind determines it's prevalence in your mind. Further, things have great worth when you don't have them. When you get whatever it is you've wanted for so long, it doesn't matter what it is, it becomes worthless. Just look back at your life and see, things that were worth so much to you at some point, now mean nothing.

\> I'm tired of being lonely and wanting someone to love me while simultaneously terrified of the extremely high probability that if I did meet someone she would likely only use me for her own gain then take my kids, my house, and half my money from me when she decides to move on. And the courts and society would side with her.

This is a contradiction. First of all, where did you get this idea about women? Since you mention social media, I would suppose this idea about women came to you from there. What were they called, black pill, blue pill, turquoise pill, lavender pill whatever.

Look, women are human beings just like men are, we want the same things, that is love, joy, fulfillment. But, people have become extremely superficial. The situations you describe above occur between people who DON'T love each other. For love, you need to be genuine and vulnerable with each other, then love can happen. But then you cannot be superficial, then you will go deep. When you go deep, understanding will happen, when you're on the surface judgement will happen.

You say you're ""terrified of the extremely high probability that if I did meet someone she would likely only use me for her own gain then take my kids, my house, and half my money from me when she decides to move on."". None of this is happening right now, you're making it all up and getting terrified of it. It's just an idea in your head, it's not in your experience, it doesn't exist for you right now, alright?

If you're going to be terrified of every possibility which may not be to your liking, you  can't live. You'll be too terrified to do anything at all. Do you know you can get run over by a car at any time while crossing or on the sidewalk? You might have cancer right now and just not know it, or you may get it at some point, do you know? An earthquake can happen and your house may crumble right on your head, do you know? I can keep going, but I hope you get the point.

And why are you singling out things to be afraid of, what about things that make you happy? Why are you focusing on women using and abusing you, women can be loving, kind, caring too, you know?

\> I'm tired of having to be the one that needs to man up, deal with it, and move forward when there's nothing worth moving towards

Man up? Deal with what? These are empty slogans, they mean nothing. Are you living the way you want or are you not?

\> I wish I'd been born a girl so I could at least go be a slut and take advantage of men for money and walk through life on easy mode with society on my side to cuddle me any time I feel oppressed. Then when my looks faded in my 30's I could kill myself having had my fun and free ride.

Please look at what you've written here, just look. Don't judge yourself for it, no, understand why you wrote this. Judgement is made by ignorant people. Once understanding is there, judgement becomes impossible.

I made the comment about wishing I had been born a girl to be a slut which I admit could have easily come across as brazen and demeaning, but if I had been born as a girl that would be my choice, and it would be wildly easier to be a slut as a female than as a man. I'm going to assume that comment is where you assumed that I hate women.

I don't hate women, I often very sincerely wish I'd been born a girl. There are plenty of days that I'm content as a guy, but generally I truly believe that life would be easier in many ways as a girl. So why would I think about wanting to have been born as a girl if I hated women? I am sincerely jealous of many aspects of the lives of women today. I'm not saying it's all sunshine and rainbows, there's certainly dangers and hardships in the world for women, no doubt. But I think there's a lot more positives for women today than for men, particularly if not perhaps exclusively in the western world which is where my perception is focused.

What I really want is to have a woman to love and spend time with and cherish, and have those emotions reciprocated and have someone to come home to who genuinely cares about me. But according to social media (and maybe I spend too much time on it), women think that men are trash and they don't need them, and they are only worth what they can provide. Unless of course he is in the top 7% of ungodly attractiveness, at which point he gets a pass.

1gapbm0,ltg7msq,t3_1gapbm0,sammybunsy,"I’m sorry - I’m not trying to be argumentative or anything. I’m just genuinely trying to understand.

Firstly, I’m a little confused as to why you believe these mental health/social issues stem from your homosexuality. Many straight people deal with the same type of romantic stagnation and isolation that you’re going through now. If you were dealing with an unsupportive, bigoted family or friend group I would totally understand how your gayness would be making you feel depressed, but that doesn’t appear to be the case with you.

It seems like you’re alluding to the conception that gay men tend to lead more lassiez faire romantic lives with juggled partners and open relationships. I can understand that you, as a clearly sensitive, highly romantic person, might not feel so accepted or welcomed by a community that you perceive to be more interested in swift sexual transaction than deep, monogamous connection.

I’m a straight man but I do have several close gay friends, and from my understanding, this characterization (or stereotype) is somewhat correct, but it’s certainly not a one-size-fits-all label you can accurately slap onto the community as a whole.

In fact, the vast majority of gay men I’ve met throughout my life have been in long term committed relationships. 

Finding a compatible partner that shares your core value set is extremely difficult for all kinds of people. Like I said, I’m straight, so you can take or leave this advice, but finding romantic partners who I jived with on a deep level became *infinitely* easier once I moved out of the suburbs and into a bustling metropolitan area. 

I don’t know what your living situation is like, but sometimes getting out into a more densely populated urban environment can significantly increase your chances of finding the kind of partner you’re looking for. 

In any case, I’m very sorry you’re feeling so down. But here’s some food for thought - I also have been feeling depressed and suicidal for a long, long time, and I have a long term partner. In fact, I’ve been in committed relationships for the majority of my adult life, and while they have brought a lot of joy and validation and connection and passion to my life, they have never really stopped me from hating myself or wishing I didn’t exist.

Even if you found the perfect man tomorrow, you’d still have to deal with yourself and all your baggage once the honey moon phase is over and your oxytocin goggles start to slip off. “Wherever you go, there you are,” and all that good stuff.

Anyways. Hope you hang in there, figure things out, and start to feel better soon, buddy.",18,2024-10-24 02:28:39

Right now, I'm trying to turn my life around. Sleeping better, exercising, and trying to find a new job. It sucks but, what I realized is that improving sleep really made me more emotionally stable and fall back less often to suicidal and self-deprecating thoughts.

I appreciate you reaching out and trying to put things in perspective, and for stating the difficult and truth. The same goes for me in that I don't want to appear argumentative. I'll try to explain my feelings.

In no way do I want to dismiss the fact that straight people go through the same things. I am fully aware these things happen across the full scope of sexuality and humanity. I also want to make clear that I'm in no way special in that regard for being gay. Indeed I have been fully accepted by family and friends and in my country the acceptence rate, freedom and liberties are among the highest in the world. In that sense I'm actually luckier than most.

I'm also not trying to state that the community has a stereotype, but it also somewhat has. There's a certain freedom that surrounds a lot of gay people and where a lot are adventurous because of it. Even in loving couples, I myself have been invited to be adventurous with couples numerous times. Again, not stating as fact or stereotype, just speaking from experience.

I do want to state that things have escalated since Covid, across the full spectrum of sexuality, not just in the gay community, but also among the straights and anything in between. That sadly is a fact. Still I know that not everyone is like that, I'm not delusional and again I'm not special for being gay whatsoever.

This might sound a bit argumentative and I'm sorry because I really don't mean it that way, it even might or probably sounds hypocrytical or dismissive and again, not what I want to sound like, but having a few gay friends doesn't account for all of the community and there are things that you don't experience or know. There are countless articles about loneliness and depression amongst gay men because od how the feel about their place in the community. To state some facts gay men experience a higher mortality and suicial rate, are more prone to cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and partake in risky sex and drugs. Just now there is an uptick of 30% in my very developed country for HIV infections.

Again, please don't get me wrong, I don't know how else to say it, but there are some differences, but also a lot of similarities.

I myself live in a very densely populated area so that isn't the issue.

Finally I will admit fully that I myself, the way I think and feel, are fully to blame and therefore have in no way any ill feelings towards people or the gay community and overall lifestyle. I wish I could be more like the others, because for a lot if not most it can result in finding someone.

Thank you for reaching out, stating your perspective and being real, I appreciate it highly.

Edit: to respond to your last part, you are absolutely right in that even if I would find the perfect guy tomorrow, it wouldn't fix all my issues and baggage, that is something I've realized some time ago and it's true.",1,2024-10-24 14:10:04

I've come to realize this too but it's still a hard thing to cope with. I'm no longer thinking it would fix everything, but I do still somewhere think that it would somehow help to have someone by my side.

I'm somewhat trying to turn things around. I've quit smoking weed about two weeks ago for the bazillionth time. It screws up my sleep schedule even more (quitting I mean), and increases and intensifies my dreams and nightmares, but from experience I know that it makes me more calm mentally, and less angry. The harder sleeps make me more emotional though and that's why I always fall back to it. I'm hoping this time I can keep clean.

about your friends and the girl you like. Life is about stages and - you would think that many people say that - but it is really true that your friends exclude you is one of the worst feelings because you can feel alone, but if they really exclude you, are they good friends? Are they really good friends of yours? I don't know much about the context and I don't want to get involved as if I knew everything, but a friend who excludes you from their plans is not such a good friend. Do they know that you are not in a good moment? Maybe if they know, they will help you if they are very good friends of yours.

Regarding the girl you like, honestly don't get sad or worry about it because there are many girls and you don't have to be sad because someone told you that because surely right now or in a while there will be a girl that you really like and she to you too.

then talk to your friends and the girl you like, in my opinion, if she told you that, don't take it into account much anymore.

1gaoc1w,ltigwmr,t3_1gaoc1w,Ritsler,"I’m a little unclear if you’re asking about support groups or about what other health professionals will do to support a suicidal patient, so I’ll give examples of both. 

Support groups in general are almost like group therapy but less formal. There may be someone leading the group but it’s mostly carried by the people in the group talking about what they’re feeling and other members offering their own stories and support. There’s support groups for all sorts of things, grief, substance use, etc. Basically, it helps you feel less alone and ideally helps you feel seen and heard by others experiencing the same thing. Support groups also tend to be free. I imagine a support group for feeling suicidal would be a bit more structured given the risk involved. 

Therapists or doctors will support someone feeling suicidal by offering therapy and/or antidepressants. In extreme cases, you could be placed on a suicide watch if you’re deemed an active risk to yourself. That would involve something like an involuntary hold and generally is only done if someone already tried something serious. Otherwise, you would attend sessions with your therapist or doctor as scheduled. If you’re on the edge, a therapist might make something called a safety plan with you which is a list of things to do if you feel overwhelmed. Things like calling a friend, going to the ER, removing dangerous objects around the house, etc. 

Antidepressants will take about 2-3 weeks to reach peek efficiency and generally help take the edge off what you may be feeling and sometimes will help you feel less stressed. You tend to feel a little more grounded and your emotions may feel slightly blunted. There are some other side effects you may experience but it varies by drug.

You said you feel empty when you are alone which does sound like a problem but not necessarily depression. A common symptom of depression is isolating, so if you feel like shit when you are alone and you're alone all the time it could be something to think about. But parents tend to worry so keep that in mind as well. Depression isn't a one size fits all, it can look different for different people. Honestly the only way you could really know is by seeing a mental health doctor (I forgot the technical term) and getting their opinion. Therapy doesn't hurt though and you don't have to have a mental illness or trauma to see a therapist.",2,2024-10-23 23:06:49

If you're still having tough time trying to talk to him, trying suggest that you both see a marriage counselor together. 

If he isn't willing to communicate in any way you'll need to seperate unfortunately. At this point it means he doesn't want to try to save your marriage and staying in marriage where you're unloved will only hurt you more.

1gan23a,ltf4qxj,t3_1gan23a,Evrakylon,"First of all I want to thank you for sharing your experiences, and I can tell you that I relate heavily with these issues. 

It's so extremely isolating, especially feeling like everyone's got it all figured out while you're not even close to understanding what's up. And when our brain is telling us that we don't fit in we read rejection in the facial expressions of others confirming our suspicion. But the very same fear of not fitting in also often clouds our own vision, makes us interpret signs that just aren't really there. 

Most people are far too preoccupied with themselves to think and analyze others, in that way we're our own worst enemy. We see signs that aren't actually anything as malicious intent. Words not spoken, a raised eyebrow, a sentence shortened, which word they used, how much they told person A compared to person B compared to us, etc. 

I think you're showing so much courage trying to address these feelings, by trying to improve your appearance, and by being more open with your struggles. It's a difficult thing to do, so I really want ro emphasize how proud you should be of that. Know that you're not less valuable even if you feel ""abnormal"", and that what you feel on the inside likely affects your confidence, your body language, how outspoken you are, etc. That's never easy. 

It might be worth it to look for spaces where you're better appreciated, maybe online communities or elsewhere? Only you know what you find meaningful, but you do deserve to feel appreciated. It can be a hobby you have, or something you find interesting, it might be worth it to look for groups dedicated to that interest. 

Be kind with yourself, life's a journey you're learning to navigate. Be patient, even if it feels rough. I wish I could offer you some more words of comfort, know that you're not alone in this. I believe with time you'll find spaces where you can be appreciated better, because you deserve it.",1,2024-10-23 22:38:18

1gamdz7,ltf0r1w,t3_1gamdz7,Two_Blue_Eyes,"While I can certainly relate to wanting to sleep all day and night to avoid dealing with anything due to depression, the only problem is it would probably take some sort of prescription to put you out like that. Even then, your body would eventually adjust to the med and the sleep benefit would decline. Plus a doctor might be hesitant to prescribe those meds.

Drugs like Lunesta for sleep and benzodiazepines can quickly cause tolerance. You do not want to risk getting dependent or addicted.

There are antidepressants such as Remeron with a very strong antihistamine effect which tends to knock people out. When I tried it, I slept for 14 hours.

The guilt of how it affects them makes my depression worse, so I really have to fight it.  Guilt really complicates depression, though it’s hard to fight.  So many things I can come with to feel guilty about. 

In periods of non-depression we’ve worked on this.  How he can help me (though there’s little he can do) and how he just has to be responsible for his own happiness.  Mostly he helps me recognize when I’m slipping towards a depression.  And I’ve realized that TRYING to appear non-depressed is exhausting and makes things worse.

Otherwise, I would recommend looking at what's important in life **to you**, because you are your own person with hobbies and interests. What helps you turn off the voices in your head? Maybe you like making/playing music or painting, getting lost in creativity? Or maybe there is a sport you always wanted to try?

At home there was no distraction, no escaping the terrible and soul crushing feelings and suicidal ideation playing in my head in a continuous loop. At least at work I had some times throughout the day where my task at hand distracted me enough not to be focused on my feelings and thoughts. So the routine was worth it. 

Besides I understood that there was only one other place I could go from there and I really did not want to leave suicide as a legacy for my son, who reminds me so much of myself at his age.

1gaj8v1,lte8jtv,t3_1gaj8v1,grasshopper_jo,"For me depression tends to flare up when I have “open loops” going on. Historically I have coped through it and then it has started to resolve only when I closed one or some of the open loops. Examples of the open loops are: obligations you don’t really want to be doing. The knowledge that you’re treating your own health like garbage. Boredom with some part of your life. Boundaries you have let slide for a long time. A job you hate. Feelings you’ve been ignoring. Some cognitive dissonance has been eroding at your well being slowly and depression is the point at which you notice it. When I reflect and slow down and figure out what it is and then start to address the thing is when it starts to let up and then my life is better afterwards. You have to move slowly in this process because making changes rapidly hoping one of them will hit, is not the way to go and you have to conserve your energy when you’re depressed because as you know it can be very low.

I don’t pretend to know it all. That’s what has worked for me and I wanted to share it in case it might work for you. I’m in pretty much exactly the same place you are right now. Recurrent depression is hard. It’s such a slog and I’m really sorry you’re in that place. Best wishes.",13,2024-10-23 19:50:50

I think most of us who struggle with depression feel like a burden to others. So we don't ask for help from our loved ones when we are really struggling. We don't want to be seen as suddenly pathetic and less than how they know us to be. But...we're not burdens, and we're not super humans either; we're normal in that we have difficult emotions, and we need love and support like everyone else. Contrary to what our depression tells us, most people who love us do in fact want to know how we're truly feeling, especially those who are also struggling with depression because they know we can empathize with them rather than just feel bad for them (the difference btwn empathy and sympathy). 


It sounds like you give a lot to the people in your life. Do you believe you're deserving of support as well? I hope so because you are!


I don't think we can snap out of our feelings, especially depression. You have every right to give space to your authentic feelings. Some potentially helpful things to consider are: opening up to a few loved ones, counselling for a while, talking to your doctor about trying an antidepressant, journaling. ",0,2024-10-24 06:18:42

1gacvfa,ltdtuki,t3_1gacvfa,Last-Distance3188,"Hey man, first of all, I just want to say that it takes a lot of courage to open up about everything you’re going through, especially in a public space like this. You’re carrying an incredibly heavy load, and the fact that you’re still standing says a lot about your strength, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now.

It’s clear how much you love your son, and despite the hell your ex has put you through, your love for him is unwavering. That’s something no one can take away from you. He will grow up knowing you did everything you could for him, and even though it’s hard right now, that bond is something she can’t break in the long run. Keep fighting for him, even when it feels like the world is against you—your effort will mean the world to him one day.

I can only imagine how frustrating and painful the situation with your ex is. It’s beyond unfair, and I’m sorry that you’re going through this. But with people starting to see through her lies, it seems like the truth is slowly surfacing. It may take time, but eventually, things will shift in your favor. Just take it one step at a time, and don’t be afraid to ask for help, whether it’s legal support, therapy, or just venting like you did here. You’re not alone, even though it feels isolating.

As for your girlfriend, it sounds like you’re doing the right thing by being supportive and understanding, but I get why the situation is tough for you too. It’s normal to feel conflicted, but the fact that you care so much about her wellbeing shows what kind of person you are. Give yourself some grace—you’re dealing with so much at once, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed by everything.

I think therapy could be a really good idea. It might help you process all of this, especially the trauma from your past, and give you tools to navigate everything you’re dealing with now. There’s no shame in needing help. You’ve been carrying so much for so long—maybe it’s time to let some of that weight off your shoulders.

You’re going through hell, man, but you’re still here. That says something. Don’t give up. Things won’t be this way forever, and your son needs you to keep pushing forward, no matter how hard it gets. You’re stronger than you think.

Stay strong, and take things one day at a time. You got this.",1,2024-10-23 18:33:48

My mom doesn’t really care and I kind of regret telling her because she said things that reinforced my suicidal thoughts into full blown ideation/planning. I think it depends on your parents, you know them best. Are they highly anxious and neurotic? If so they might worry too much, which could make everyone involved including you feel worse. If they’re extremely narcissistic and abusive like my mother, and likely to intentionally say things to make you feel worse, not telling them may be better for your mental health. 

In most situations though, if you have good parents that love you, I think it would be a good idea to tell them, especially if their own mental health seems relatively stable. You’re their kid, they love you (I hope), they probably would want to know about your struggles and help you through them. And if they don’t have anything helpful to offer in return, just don’t bring it up again. But I think it’s worth a shot as long as you trust them",1,2024-10-23 15:02:01

1ga2mue,ltbkb8j,t3_1ga2mue,PuffTrain,"Hey, I moved from the West to Asia years ago. This is totally normal, it takes a good 3-6 months to really settle in, find the grocery stores that sell everything you're missing, establish favourite restaurants, meet people, make your apartment feel homey etc. 

One of the hardest parts is not having a deadline. It might help if you tell yourself you'll give it 3 months, and then you'll go home if you want to. It's just a 3 month working holiday! Also, so many factors can affect your enjoyment! Literally just living in the wrong suburb can be the difference between hating a country and loving it, and moving somewhere a little less chaotic is also an option, and your boyfriend *should* be supportive of that, because it's not fair on either of you to ignore your misery because he's happy. 

Keep your chin up, I've moved countries three times now and it is objectively tough. You're not weak or not meant for this, you absolutely will adjust if you give yourself some time. Imagine two months from now. *You've settled in at work and know your way around the city, and you're on your way to your favourite local spot to meet a new friend for a drink. You feel peaceful, yet joyously overwhelmed with the sheer beauty and magic of the city.* You can have that. You just have to take it easy on yourself, do your best, and absolutely stay in bed all day and watch movies when you're feeling homesick (every expat feels like that occasionally, especially at first). 

Breathe. Shift your focus from yourself to this beautiful new city and all the people hurrying around you with their own lives, joys, and miseries. And if/when you are ready to leave, you can! And you can also go back to Japan later! It often feels like these big decisions are permanent but in the grand scheme of things everything is temporary.",72,2024-10-23 10:43:28

But luckily my host family said they will be responsible for me and take care of me, so I got to stay. This happened maybe in the first 3-4 months when I was there. Afterwards I got better once I’m more used to the environment, I started making an effort to make friends, enjoy the culture and food, and at the end of my 10 months stay, I didn’t want to leave.

I’m not saying everyone will be the same, but I do understand the first few months in a foreign place can feel very overwhelming, and that it can affect you greatly. Give it a bit more time and see if it gets better, if not, then perhaps consider going back home instead.",18,2024-10-23 11:56:32

I also went to several other Asian countries, but none of those countries made me feel the way Japan did. When I saw the movie Lost in Translation (about a lonely American living in Japan) a few years later it reminded me of that experience. 

Here’s my opinion, though I won’t be offended if you ignore it: when you live in another country and learn how to adapt to their way of life it changes you, and I believe it gives you a useful skillset that you can keep forever. If you can adapt to Japan as a European you can adapt to just about anything else in life. 

Maybe you finish up the year and think nah, this isn’t for me. If so, well, you still made it through the year and that counts for something. But you may start to love it, and it would be a shame to leave before you have the opportunity to overcome that initial culture shock.

1. It gets me out of the house and gives me something to look like I have a purpose/ know what I’m doing 
2. no one pays attention to anyone else in a grocery store and you can wander around for as long or as short as you like and leave without buying anything 
3. I can reward myself with buying a few things without it being expensive or wasted
4. While the items may be different, the actual act of grocery shopping is something that is completely familiar and the same everywhere you go. You walk around, turn apples over in your hands, pick things up and put them down again — it’s easy, and most importantly: 
5. It takes no mental effort. *Being in an unfamiliar country with a different language takes constant and unceasing mental effort until you’re comfortable there.*

Put on headphones and play something familiar to normalize it even more.

But, at the end of the day though, you are not his parent, and you should not have to feel any guilt for how he turns out, nor should you be pressured to have to help or teach him. Or as I like to say, NMP, not my problem.

Distance yourself from him when you can, and work to help yourself and to deal with your mental health issues. 

If your parents wont do anythign about it, and if they are even aggressive ormean about it, then dont go to them about it, focus on recovery, and start thinking about the possibility of moving away from your family, if there this toxic to you.

The truth is, it's not realistic to try make radical changes in your life overnight. And motivation is a very unreliable resource to rely upon in the long term, cause it's just its nature to ebb and flow, and sometimes it's not even there.  

If you have identified what areas of your life you can improve on, I suggest you stick to creating small habits over a period of time that would stack on one another and eventually manifest as the more fulfilling lifestyle you desire.

How I have dealt with it is being calm and showing humility. Being honest and sincere with emotions and treating your partner like they are also your best friend that you can tell them anything about. Its not perfect but it does help calm everything down because anyone can lash out when they are unhappy. I think it might have something to with some partners not able to take criticism or they react negatively if they feel responsible when you have complaints so they get defensive. They may also lash out because the things they want to do make them feel selfish and guilty. I get frustrated in arguments when my partner code switches to a different personality.

Now that's out the way 

This is just my opinion, someone that suffers from depression, is male , had only had high function successful woman in my life, including family and lovers. 

I think it's natural for a male to feel insecure if their SO is high functioning, this is something we socially created and stigmatized, due to the social structures we put in place. Equality is rather young project. It is also an evolutionary trait for a male to ""provide"" as we were the hunters. It's my assumption that these two reasons could bring about feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.

The insecurity/inadequecy can lead him down a spiral of avoidance, hence the gaming, drinking etc this will eventually lead to depression, which is a wide range of negative thoughts. 

Best is to talk about it and how you guys are a unit, in attempt to survive this landscape we call life. Acceptance of the situation could also help, stoic philosophy is really helpful with excepting things for how they are, not really an advocate of the stoics, but that area is sometimes helpful. 

There is alot to unpack in what you said, but I just pointed out what I could relate to. 

FYI, my depression doesn't stem from what was mentioned above, it's just something I thought about, being around high functioning woman all my life.

First class, first day, he realized he was going to need to study and he promptly dropped out. He could have been top in his field if he knew how to study, how to work hard.

A good washing machine works like so, you get all your dirty clothes that compiled over a period of time, put them in, drizzle some detergent, then run it, take the load out, dry it, and bam you’ve got clean warm dry clothes, then you dirty them up, and the cycle continues over and over again. 

It sounds like you’re putting in the work of getting your dirty clothes in the washing machine, but you’re forgetting the most fun and best smelling part, drizzling that detergent and making those clothes squeaky clean and smelling like heaven. so what you’re left with load after load is dirty clothes. Think of the detergent or fabric softener as all of the small yet good things in life. You need them to keep living and stay clean, and you constantly have to use it/remind yourself of them to feel good about putting on a clean warm shirt and excited to start another load. you need to find things to look forward to. and I’m not talking about vacations or weekends bc god knows those things come and go like nothing, I mean everyday things, things that you would normally miss at work or during your 35 minute drive, things that you can jot down and say, I’m grateful for this. and i know it sounds super stupid and its so easy to get all cynical about it, and everyones a pessimist these days. but really really try, everyday, even just one thing, because I promise the feeling of putting on a warm clean outfit is the best feeling in the world.",1,2024-10-23 01:40:54

Hi, OP. First of all, I want to say that I understand you, I'm ugly too, if judged by beauty standards. It made me suffer for a long time, but now I feel much easier about it. The fact is that beauty, like many other things, is fickle and changeable. Now beautiful people are young, so they do it, but everyone will grow old and lose their beauty someday. This is not the kind of thing that will be with them forever. And even if we don't talk about aging, everyone can get into an accident or something similar, getting scars that ""disfigure"" them. Understanding all this is liberating. There is no point in clinging and suffering for beauty if we all have the same outcome - aging and death.

Jokes aside, I don't think beauty fades so easily with age. I know women (and men) in 50s, 60s and possibly even 70s+ who are still beautiful. Some of it may be genetics, but in general I think a lot of it comes from the inside.

Astounding visual attractiveness is not really as cool as you might think:  
""They get friends automatically."" Trust me, they don't. People who will flock to you only because they find you visually attractive are notoriously bad friends in general.  
I have seen it way too many times where people who look like friends from an outsider's perspective really do not wish a single good thing to one another.  
I know people who ""are friends"" and hang out regularly, but without fail as soon as one of them leaves, the others start to talk about them in a negative way. It is disgusting and you don't really want too many people of that caliber in your ""inner circle.""  
Yes, good looking extroverts have a much easier time getting buddies and people to hang out with, than shy introverts. But they can also have difficulties being on their own, always chasing bad relationship and coming out of each more damaged than they were.

Do you know how many young ladies I know, that you might look at and say: ""wow, she has such a perfect life! All the boys like her, she is so sociable, she has so many friends around her, etc.""?  
The same ladies cry in their cars before going to their house, because that is the only space they feel safe in to let all those feelings out. (even tho they have soooo many ""friends."")  
And I'm not talking about some shallow, unintelligent women who happen to look really good. No! Most of them are sweet, smart, one is a dog trainer and she's absolutely great at her job. But that doesn't stop them from feeling completely sad and alone at times.

If you're cute by default and you're also a decent person that is already huge! I can only speculate, as I know nothing about you, but I think it's possible that it's not your perceived lack of attractiveness that's the issue, but your relatively low sense of self-worth.  
I am by no means judging you, but because you said you feel ashamed, it made me think that you might have some unconscious feelings of guilt or shame that are manifesting as low self-esteem, people-pleasing behavior, or just make you appear ingenuine when interacting with others.  
But it's this unconscious behavior that makes you feel alienated. (I am speaking from personal experience)

Sorry for the potato post and not really offering any practical ways to figure out what the main problem is... But for me, realizing that it wasn't my physical attractiveness that was the main issue; my thinking and generally poor self-image were.  
With enough time those lead to a whole lot of self-sabotage (on an unconscious level) and self-fulfilling prophecies (""I'm unlovable."" ""I'm not attractive enough."" ""I'm not xx enough..."").",1,2024-10-23 17:51:02

I was once in a situation where i had to end things with my gf to get more time and space to work with my depression. I felt the positive effects allmost immediately.

She was kinda supportive on the surface and the relationship was ok, but at times she got kinda nasty and said very hurtfull things. It didn’t help that she was sexually very needy and when i’m deep down in my depressive phase, my libido is allmost non-existent. At that time, once a week was more than enough for me. I felt strangled. I couldn’t focus on myself enough and felt miserable thinking what’s wrong with me. 

After we broke up, i felt free and i was able to start working towards my well being without compromises. One of the best choices i’ve ever made. I got more energy and was able to meet new ppl and started doing more things outside the house. 

Don’t get me wrong, i didn’t beat depression all of a sudden just by dumping my gf. But it was definetely a step in the right direction for me at that point in time.

I still struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts, but i’m determined to get out of this some day and i’m working towards that goal every day.

I think its a good way to start wondering, what were you thinking about, what do you feel like, and what you think is the cause of your state of mind when you were depressed.

And, wonder right now, what are you feeling? what is the cause, what do you feel like is the thing you want to do all day, in the future, and so on.

Generally questioning yourself is a good thing, and you can pretty much tell if its depression or just a big shock. Honestly it could be both; you go into shock first, then depression. And I'm hoping that isn't the case. Try to focus on deflecting those bad thoughts, and we people here in reddit are all about positivity.

I've stopped drinking after probably 15 years of being a ""wine mom"" and there's a lot of old shit bubbling up.  My therapist tells me I'm supposed to just notice my feeling sad and accept it, don't try to avoid it.  Kind of give your inner child a hug that you are feeling sad and have compassion about it.  And tell yourself that moods are like weather, rain comes and it goes.  You can't stop it but it never stays forever.  The downside of this is you DO feel sad.  And most of us don't want to do that.

Schools usually offer therapy for students and better help offers free online sessions (don’t know if you need parent permission for those though). I’m sure if you tell a teacher or faculty about your situation they’ll be willing to give you the help you need.  Now, you’re not actually talentless. You just haven’t found something you have a talent for. There are millions of things to do on this earth, you’re going to find something you’re passionate about and can become talented in. Most people aren’t born with talent, they become talented through consistency and work. Next, Looks aren’t everything, you can still get a girlfriend and a friend group with a good personality. Right now what I’d focus on is fixing your self image and outlook. Don’t pay attention to how you look since there isn’t anything you can change about that, but focus on improving yourself mentally.

Sometimes you're looking for it and it eludes you every time. My advice - think about what you want in a partner. Would this person even be the type to go on a dating app? Would they be at a bar? If not then don't waste your time looking there. I don't know what you're into but if you're a regular at a coffee shop then make small talk with the barista and see if it goes anywhere. For men, they really don't get complimented often so a compliment can go a long way. Also the good and sweet ones tend to be oblivious or scared they will make someone uncomfortable and might not make a move. Be bold, you only live once and some embarrassment won't kill you, it'll be worth it for some partnership. My current boyfriend knew I had feelings for him yet was still unsure about asking me out in fear of making me uncomfortable, so I had to ask him out. I panicked and very loudly told him (infront of many friends by the way) that he needed to date me. It was horribly embarrassing but definitely worth it. Girls tend to be more perceptive but also preferred to be asked out so you are going to have to embrace rejection no matter who you want. For the time being, maybe think about what partner you would like to be. Are there things you'd want to improve on or certain love languages you like? What do you want out of a relationship?

And now when i look back i hardly remember it as all that bad.

When I left for college, a new world opened for me. I made real friends and had real, solid romantic relationships. I built a life for myself, worked jobs I never thought I'd have, felt the joy of renting my first apartment, eventually ended up with multiple careers--first a journalist, then a social worker, then back to journalism. I eventually sold a manuscript to a publishing house.

Ironically, it was a memoir about how ridiculously bad my high school years were.

I'm actually grateful for it now because without going through the crap in high school, I don't know if I would have achieved my ultimate dream of selling a manuscript. Also, while writing my book, I contacted people from school to share stories and we realized so much of what seemed awful then was now funny, as an adult. It feels awful when you're a kid because you don't have a lot of freedom to choose your own life, but that freedom comes in adulthood.

And remember, the bank adds interest to your account, so all you have to do is keep your money in there, and it'll create money out of thin aire. 

Your memories are the interest. You just stay alive and they happen.   
 
My bday is Dec 18. I'll be 54 and my memory interest is off the chart. I've lived in many, many towns and scenic places, toured in my van with my band, travelled to every state, was a truck driver and lived in my truck. I live in nyc now. I was homeless a year ago. Now I have an apartment, a job as a counselor helping people, and I still write songs and perform. Just compiling all the memories into memoirs for my biography requires two duffel bags. I need an editor.   

I attempted suicide twice in high school. Then I said screw it...and I lived. For the interest. I lost a lot of friends and family along the way that didn't approve. But now I have real friends that are my family. They love me for me. And people want to hear my story. I've been interviewed and invited to speak. Not many live the way I did and do, and they love to hear about it. It was their dream, too, maybe...but I lived it. Still am. 

My friend in a tiny town in Illinois loves my photos and stories. She's never been anywhere. I am usually the most interesting person in the room. I don't try to be. I am shy and self-concious. But people pull it out of me. I don't mind. But it's not my intention to share when I meet a person. I want to hear THEIR story. But then they ask about me. So I tell them. There is no gist of the story for me. I could have lived a less interesting life. I could have died, too.

Keep reminding yourself that what you feel right now is okay, it’s okay to feel sad or down, but those feelings do change along with the circumstances. I still get depressed at times, but I keep asking myself “What is true or factual?” vs. “What is a judgment?” 

It’s true that I’m feeling sad, but it is not a fact that I am a failure, or I can never be happy again. The fact is I am a person who is going to have feelings and experiences. The fact is time keeps moving, and so the world will continue to change, along with my experience of it.

When it happened I was drunk so I don’t really remember how I felt right after but for a while I just ignored it happened since nobody even noticed I had attempted. In the years following I was almost always somewhat suicidal, but never really had the courage to try again.

1g9q48z,lt7wf4d,t3_1g9q48z,Aggravating_Self8262,"As someone with depression, I totally get it. Some days are just better than others. It's great that the med has been helping you and has helped in the past but if it has stopped helping it might be a good idea to reach out to your doctor. You also said it was a recent increase, idk how recent but maybe it just needs some more time to kick in? Also my advice is starting small and trying not to beat yourself up over what wasn't done. Don't think you're going to go from sleeping all day to cleaning your entire living space and starting a business lol. Maybe just get up and drink a glass of water or do some self-care to make yourself feel better. Make a list of relatively small things you can do for yourself like washing your face or work for 5 minutes on a hobby you like. Then when you really don't want to do much you can refer to it and pick something easy that doesn't take a lot of motivation. I like to think of it as giving depression a taste of it's own medicine, it's a cycle that makes you not want to do anything and then feel bad about it which makes you not do anything and so on. Well you can reverse it by building up just a little bit of steam. Some days you might do something small and then still feel shitty but at least you can say you did it. Other days that small accomplishment will build and give you a little bit more confidence, motivation, or energy. This isn't guaranteed to work, everyone si different and there are some days it works for me and some days it doesn't. But it can help. Also like what you said about going to the gym, try not to compare to how you did at your best. So instead of being like damn I used to be able to bench 150 and now I can't, try to think if it as damn I havent worked out in a long time and I can still bench 90.

Maybe a hobby that distracts you. Also I'm definitely not a doctor but if you aren't diagnosed with anxiety you might want to get tested for it. Finding hobbies that you really enjoy can definitely help, depression can get in the way of them which sucks but remember it's not always on you. Also remember everyone sucks when they first do something, it's how we know we can improve. Find a hobby and embrace the suck, you'll get better and it can improve your confidence.

I just sigh and roll my eyes at such remarks.  If things were that easy, my life would be much better today.

In my case, I suffer from nostalgic depression, which means I repeatedly wish I could go back to my childhood and feel severely miserable because it's not possible (unless someone invents a time machine).  My childhood was back during the 1980s, and, although some things were not pleasant, most of the time, my life back then was much happier than my current ""existence"" (if I can even call it that).

One thing I'm unable to do, no matter how miserable my life is, is take my own life.  I often threaten to do that when I have really bad days, but the thought of ending my life is too terrible and terrifying for me to go through with it.

I was so quiet for so long that one or two friends reached out to ME, and months later they're like ""sorry for being selfish but I need a break"". I wish I'd made up some excuse about being ill in some other way.

It's the absolute worst advice to reach out to friends about it, they're just not equipped to handle it, and they think you're reaching out to them for their support (when in reality you just want them to know, to understand, and to apologise for your absence). Reach out to parents, family, and seek therapy. But unless you have a friend who is knowledgeable, leave other friends out of it. Just tell them that you've got a vague illness and apologise for your absence. Don't tell them you have a mental illness, it's an invisible scary taboo condition and the fear it instills in others will ruin your relationships.

I never wanted to tell my friends about it, I never wanted to trouble them or be a burden. Now I'm being shut out by them and I feel the exact thing I feared in the first place. Being a burden.

Talk to family. Talk to a therapist. Talk to others on here. But leave your friends out.

I was a good student, went to gym regularly before that. Made time to socialize and all these things. Now that I'm not able to do these things like I used to, I'm labelled as lazy. I question myself all the time. I never workout anymore and my academic life is at its worst. I always try to figure out if I've been stupid this whole time and never noticed. I don't even now if I'm lazy or not. I'm trying to make things work but I can't live normally like I used to. I've been taking my meds and eating healthy for the last 2 months.

It’s fine to talk to someone when you need a little lift, but sometimes it can get overwhelming for them in their life, doesn’t mean they don’t care, or that you should stop talking altogether. 

Find the right people for you, and also understand that you can listen to yourself too. As crazy as it might sound, you can also be there for yourself. 

How you may ask? 
- Record yourself like you would be taking to a friend
- Journal or write your feelings down
-Paint whatever you are feeling (ugly or bad, you just need to get the red and black out of your head.)
- Cry, scream, walk, 
- Sing it! And loud! As loud as you can. 

People are scared of what they don’t understand, you included. As much as your feelings scare you, they can scare other people off. It’s okay, forgive them. But forgive yourself too for needing it. 

And reach out for professional help, these people are paid to care. As much as it may sound depressing, they chose to be there and to help people like you. 

And they do care. Maybe not the way you want them to, but maybe the way you need. 

Anyway! Good luck!",6,2024-10-22 17:21:10

Saying you want a psychologist because “you feel a bit strange or want a new experience” won’t cut it. It even may cut it, but what if someone pressures me further? Wanting to ask what’s happening? That is fearful.

I feel so strange. I have little hopes, and I always feel crushed in presence of my succeeded friends. I’m a failing person.

Some people overly judge me for the failure I am. That stresses me out and makes me so sad. I don’t know what to do to make this better without having to admit things and try harder, because my will’s too weak and I’m stuck on social medias 24/7. So shameful.",2,2024-10-22 19:51:30

1g9mnuy,ltbfef2,t3_1g9mnuy,MillionaireBank,"I'm just now finding out the case management isn't available either. It's been hard I've decided that I'm being denied care because there's something wrong with me or they don't like me and it's personal. 

Only that's not true either they don't care. What I had a mother and father that used to neglect my symptoms I realized that I valued my mental health or my personal feelings in a different way and my caregivers didn't value me and didn't try and help me but I'm my own mother and father to get my own help I'm disabled as well. So this is a conundrum for me to navigate and I asked these doctors can't I go to pain management where I don't have to find a car ride for it? I'm afraid to get into the car I am afraid to be driven anywhere I'm afraid of driving. My car wreck 14 months ago and being homeless for a few months has ruined my life. I'm ruined why am I being punished why am I being sent on a confusing gas lighting routine that reminds me of the neglect and refusal to care that my parents did to me I resent my mother and father and I resent professionals for not helping me because that's three parties that are let Downs complete letdowns.

There's nothing wrong with seeking help earlier this week this professional was confused and on a blame mode of telling me that I'm the problem and that I mentally ill and I said yeah I'm a bipolar failure to thrive case I need my medication here are two illnesses and here are three medications for it where are my medicines? And that's where they are they don't want to help me and they want to see where I disabilize and where I fail

They want me to fail is what I concluded so here I am disabled from bipolar and the doctors tell me that I'm the problem with all of these labels? Then I get care for over 20-30 years and now they want to mess around with it and remove care and change care. yeah okay life is full of change.

I've also noticed that I'm being asked to be tough and strong and carry all of this and I can't and that's why I take medicine it's so strange that I have to keep on repeating myself and explaining myself about the same things that I keep managing decade after decade and why? Because this is where it is I can't help it I am a broken person that keeps on asking for help in a place in a nation that doesn't want to help anybody. They want to blame everybody make fun of everybody tell me it doesn't exist. Uses denialism or declinism

Narcissism recovery coursework from YouTube helps me cope with mental health professionals they have a God complex they believe or they stigmatize everybody that there are drug user or crazy person and I don't have time to go back to the 1950s but since I live in the 1950s I just figure okay I'm a woman I'm a piece of garbage??? Is that what I'm supposed to think? No it's just a holding pattern over medical Care. Every year every decade every fad every little dinky inexperienced unqualified professional and not even making $8 an hour is going to tell me about mania or depression they really can sit down and shut up. Because they don't know anything.

In jest, I've learned with mental health care the last year that I'm a piece of garbage😂🤣👆☝️🆙🧵 and that's the complete opposite of what I've experienced that's where I know that my mental health care is being removed from me and they are destabilizing me and they hate me. Because there's no reason to keep on making me suffer and to ignore me I'm being ignored and so are the rest of you these are the common routine existing concerns to take in stride and to carry.

How in 2024 and I'm being asked to suffer. It's not okay that this post is at Reddit and we are all here talking about our experiences 😂🤣💩🤣😂in the removal and the rejection of care. 

I don't have time and neither do you to live in a place of suspended reality or a delusion where it's the person's fault for seeking pain management I am not strong I needed management and I needed my medication giving back to me my anxiety and insomnia is unbearable however I keep carrying it because I'm not giving up on myself..I am experienced with parents and family neglect so when I experience medical neglect I realize this is a communication problem I have to find a new communicative doctor is that what I'm supposed to think? See that's the problem I don't want to worry about another person and I don't care about professionals I want my medical care I wonder if I'm being denied care because I'm a woman and they think that I'm all about abortion I'm all about getting my mental health care and my anxiety and insomnia meds.

What a joke 🤦‍♀️🧘‍♀️😂🤣 what a bunch of little hoops to jump through I wonder what it's going to prove?ngry at medical Care for rejecting me and letting me go this is not a job where you neglect and tell people no this is suffering people that are medical patients I'm a patient you are a patient.
 
He had patients are ignored because patients don't matter? Is that what I'm supposed to think? After I looked at all of this two days ago I made an appointment for therapy and therapy is another hoop to jump through and this is important because they owe me case management 

And that's a big mistake for me because they don't owe me anything even though I'm disabled they don't owe me anything they don't know me and I don't know them. So it's a lot of carrying everything myself and taking everything in stride and living with pain living in pain and simply enduring it all but that also means that I can't function in life so I'm more of an ineffective person without my medication so I tell people this week and this month I am ineffective and don't rely on me that's exactly what I tell everybody in my life never rely on me for anything.",2,2024-10-23 09:54:04
1g9mnuy,ltbgbtu,t3_1g9mnuy,MillionaireBank,"Thank you op, your post helped me talk. The therapy appointment is taking time. Venting is good.

I don't like how I feel confusion over my medical care I don't have confusions or mysteries in my life everything is cut and dry and so very plain and I don't like mysteries I don't like murkiness I just wish I had my refills I feel as though that the doctors worry that I'm a failure to thrive case maybe they shouldn't give me medication maybe they should just let me be upset or work it out myself and I told them no no I can't work it out myself I'm not strong enough the anxiety and inside me know will break up my appetite I really need my medication my stomach gastroscoping needs done and I can't take a bunch of medications I just have to have my stomach and mind calm they don't want to write my anti-nausea medication. So it's a lot of weight and see I'm not angry anybody I'm hurt at my own outcomes and at my own circumstances not anybody else. I still believe that medical professionals are Earth Angels maybe my medical professional Earth Angel is having a terrible week maybe they too are suffering as well. I don't want to have a relationship with my doctors where their mothers and fathers over me because my mother and father were neglectful and unreliable my medical care is reliable and now my medical care has become unreliable and neglectful. And I don't like reliving that narcissism and that denialism over my medical care telling me that I don't have problems when I clearly do and the doctors agree so why are they uncomfortable with treating me I wonder where medicine changed because I haven't changed I can't get better and maybe that's why they don't want to treat me maybe they don't want to treat me or care about me because I can't get better maybe that's it?

 I don't know I don't like the questioning myself the questioning them I like to rely upon and have good faith and happiness with my medical care I don't hate medical Care I don't understand denying medical Care.

  working on my podiatry vision Care and dental for two solid years since being homeless. The car accident 14 months ago is another setback to hug and carry and taking stride and have compassion over.

There's so much recovery and rebuilding that takes place I can't seem to recover. I imagine doctors hearing this or seeing this realize well this person is a lost cause and don't give them medicine. That's what I left questioning myself with

I try and comfort myself with it's all working out for me and it will be okay and I'm just the confused party whatever it is in life I usually blame myself and say I'm the confused party and I just walk away. Only I can't walk away from medical Care and that's a lot to carry",2,2024-10-23 10:03:54

It is so much easier to get help the younger you are.. took several med changes but finally found a mix that does pretty well. I need to find a new counselor because I moved but there are people who are in the psychology field who know this is their calling and want to help you any way they can….

It's not that they don't care; they don't know how to handle it.

They don't know how to set boundaries, and some will ghost you because of that.

Some can't bear the weight of knowing that you are suffering and that they can't help you.

I was lucky when I experienced severe mental health issues because at that point my mom had the money to send me to therapy, even when they racked up the payments after forgetting to send the bill multiple times, we were able to afford it. 

People are busy, and it’s no one’s responsibility to take care of your mental illness. You can ask for support but you can’t expect them to be around and supportive 24/7. Mental health requires you to want to get help as well, and for you to work through it. The support is there to help guide you in the right direction. Therapy can be useful and there are many workers who really care about their clients. You just have to give them a chance.

Therapy is like medication, it’s not always gonna be suitable for you but there is someone out there who is suitable to you. Even though there’s the argument that “therapists do it for the money”, that’s not always the case, I mean yea, like everyone else, they need a job to be stable. But who else would do it if not them?

Far more than a ""normal"" person would ever need to. And people have limits.

I have absolutely no idea what it would take to make me feel anything more than brief moments of okayness. I don't know who else to ask for help. They say to get help - get help WHERE? SHOW ME!

You mustn't trap yourself in, as you descibe it, would've, could've, should've type thinking.

Going back to where this all happened has triggered you into feelings of limerance which is quite understandable and not in any way 'insane'. Having said that, it isn't the reality.

Being more direct with your feelings would not have kept that guy long term. If you were 'the one' he wouldn't have dismissed you and moved onto another girl so easily. That's no shame on you and shouldn't be pondered over. I hope that doesn't sound too harsh but I want to be honest with you.

Now, without him by your side, you've made an truly admirable amount of achievements that many of us may never do. Take a big pat on the back from me. You did real good!

Now you've come here to vent things out, I hope you'll be able to process these feelings, get them through your system and leave them in the past, where they belong. It may even be a good idea going forward to mute/remove some of those Facebook friends if their posts will occasionally reveal what's happening in this guys life. It'll only trigger you and knock you off balance again and again.

Once all that's done, focus all of your love and energy toward your husband and child. Remember, they are what really fulfilled you these past few years, just as you have said.

I've also got ADHD and autism, but I'm lucky that it just makes me hella extroverted without the self-awareness to know if someone's side-eyeing me or thinking I'm strange.

A solution I've found, at least for people on the more introverted side, is trying to find someone with similar interests. Be it a special interest or a hyperfixation, it's VERY easy to have someone stick around if there's things to talk about. Also, clinging to one person isn't a bad thing ! As long as it isn't debilitating for either party, having a small circle of friends or just one close person is actually preferable to some folks. I recommend talking to people that also have autism, as it makes it easier to unmask and kinda be yourself.

1g9khil,lt6r74k,t3_1g9khil,SimileQuotes,"Yeah depression can lead you to believe Life has nothing more to offer you. 

You don’t have to “desire” something to do it. What helped me personally was doing the things people around me liked until I start liking them too. 

You don’t need a goal to stay alive. You can decide to be purposeless and take every day as it comes. Life doesn’t have to be “one thing”, you can decide day to day to reinvent yourself and find new meanings in the dislikes. 

Also, and I’m saying this because it worked for me, what are the things you hate the least? What are the things that you may not love or like but you can tolerate. Maybe those are the things you should focus on. 

A hobby doesn’t have to be interesting, or exciting or useful. As long as it passes the time and makes you feel like you’re not completely alone, it helps. 

Contemplating and sleeping are nice but they can make you feel so numb, your body physically needs to do things and move. Even if it’s small movements, it’s better than nothing. 

Your age doesn’t define what’s left for you. I get it, you’re having a small existential crisis because you’re starting to feel old and experienced, tired and fucking done. 

Another thing that helps is the word: Yes. It can lead to so many good and bad stories that make your life a whole lot more interesting. And it can trigger hope. 

Maybe today wasn’t your best, forgive yourself for feeling this way. Accept that you don’t want to have dreams and goals because you don’t feel like you’re worth it. It’s okay to feel like that. Just know that today, is just 24 hours. And that you may not feel better tomorrow, might feel worse, but you can get better, and you’re allowed to want better. 

Maybe that’s could be your dream and goal: become happier, healthier everyday. It’s a choice. You don’t have to make it today tho. Take your time.

Anxiety can affect your body in various ways, as can stress and depression.  The digestive system is often one of the first things to suffer.  You can experience nausea, lack of appetite, constipation, diarrhoea, etc.  Anxiety can also result in breakthrough phobias that you perhaps didn't have before.  Depression can take your energy and your life force away.  Anxiety, stress and depression can all affect your sleeping patterns, as can the digestive issues that result from those three conditions.  You can also develop digestive conditions like IBS as a result of stress.  It's all a vicious circle.

What can also happen is GERD, as in acid reflux, which can cause nausea and is exacerbated by not eating.  That again is a vicious circle.  You feel sick, so you don't eat and you feel more sick.  At my worst I was eating a single small tin of red salmon and a few cherry tomatoes per day.  The rest of the time I was shovelling down antacids like Rennies.  Many years on and I know better.

I have been struggling with my eating all year this year. it's extremely hard to eat. but I know I have to. because it isn't gonna help me.

I'm glad I'm not alone. I didn't realize how common emetophobia was lol. but it's just the waiting-game now to see a doctor. which I think is making me feel worse because I'm basically struck with these symptoms until I can see one.😭",2,2024-10-22 17:41:28
1g9jeq0,lt7hwmg,t1_lt7f7wz,Infobot147,"I also used to do the starve and then binge kind of eating and it doesn't do your digestive system any favours in the long term.  It's better to have a more consistent diet and to try and skip things like carbonated drinks, coffee, spicy food, garlic, etc.  They can all cause over production of acid, as can excessive dairy.

Emetophobia can be hard to live with because you can struggle to determine stomach bug nausea from anxiety nausea.  If it's usually up in your chest then it's more likely to be anxiety nausea.  Stomach bug nausea tends to be more below the rib cage and comes with cramping.

Being single by choice is nice, but when all your friends are married/coupled and with kids, they still want to involve you but you still feel like such an outlier. My best friend and I used to talk multiple times a week if not everyday, now I'm hard-pressed to get a reply from her for days at a time, but she posts sweet loving stuff on facebook, so it hurts my feelings a lot that she's more into social media and her boyfriend than replying to me. 

She's been struggling herself lately with the death of her father in May and a separation, so I've been trying to periodically check on her and make sure she's doing okay, but when she doesn't reply, it makes me feel useless. Then, when I struggle, I can't reach out to her bc a) she's going through her own shit and b) she doesn't reply. But, I've put so much of my heart into my friendship with her that I don't really have many other friends and therefore my social interactions are her and her fam or my parents, and it's starting to feel like a pity invite more than a ""I want to spend time with you"" invite. She just feels so far away. 

I've made plans with a couple of other friends I haven't seen in a bit, and I'm hoping that helps bring me out of the ""I'm so alone"" funk, but there's a piece of me that still feels so ignored and abandoned by my best friend who always promised to be there for me, but she's wrapped up in a new life she's made for herself that doesn't seem to have room for me much anymore, and it's just... hard. 

It's hard to have these feelings and problems as an adult, bc solutions when you're younger seem so much easier and simpler, and your support system is a bit greater when you're young in my opinion, and as people grow older that system tends to wane and split when people start moving on with their lives and you can't keep up.

I questioned my existence a lot too and didn't see the point of being alive when all I did was be in suffering all the time and just like you I never planned to kill myself but I wished I were dead - it's called being passivly suicidal. So I got help, started seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis and a psychiatrist for medication and ever since I'm on antidepressants I'm not in constant emotional pain anymore. You shouldn't feel guilty for having no external reason to be depressed because depression is a disease, it's a chemical inbalance in your brain and it can be treated. Just because it isn't a physical or ""visible"" illness it doesn't make it any less serious. So I hope you have the strength to reach out and get help - a therapist and medication. And I think that once you are feeling better you might actually figure out what you want to do with your life and that will motivate you to keep on living - I think the reason you can't figure it out right now is because you don't want to even be around so it feels like there's no point into even finding out anything.

There doesn’t need to be a purpose to everything. It’s dubious trying to figure that out. You have the ability to create a life worth living, and it’s incredibly hard to see that when you’re in a depressed state. I was there too. For 5 years. Now, I’m 24 and finally moved out of my parents’ place, but that didn’t happen overnight. I took a job I hated, learned what else was out there, and found my current job based on that. You don’t need to know what you want to do or why you’re here. You get to make your own narrative. It’s fucking hard, but it’s possible. Small steps are what make a huge difference. Easier said than done, but as DBT has taught me, the first steps are making sure you’re eating, working out, showering and then everything will start to make a little more sense.

And know that even if you have a lot of problems, regardless of what they are, you're still \*you\*. And that's something nobody else can do.

1g9e1rd,lt5cjx9,t3_1g9e1rd,Impressive_Ad8556,"hi there! sorry to hear that you're going through this but also kudos for wanting to show up for your partner and help them through this slump. i had a similar period in my life where i was unable to work due to physical health issues and i felt very limited on what i could do. being low on income for me caused a lot of insecurity as i also couldn't do things i enjoyed/felt like my partner wanted to do more but i just couldn't make those things happen. if you're able to, maybe try to plan dates that don't require much, such as dates at home where you both make lunch/dinner, watch a movie, play a videogame etc. and just enjoy eachothers company. if your partner has asked you to be more assertive prior, then i also think thats another great option, just make sure that its coming from a place of understanding. but also, it's always a good idea to remember how you feel! if you feel in your heart that they are not reciprocating the effort you are trying to put in, please share these feelings with them. they may not even realize how closed off they're becoming. being in a relationship is a team effort from both sides :)
i hope this helps, good luck !!",1,2024-10-22 09:53:58
1g9dxbd,lt5edy0,t3_1g9dxbd,Destroyer_2_2,"Well, I am by no means an expert, but I’ve been depressed my whole life, and I feel like I have an important piece of advice:

By believing that mental health wasn’t a real affliction, and instead entirely within one’s own control, you allowed yourself to feel power. You allowed yourself to feel fully in charge of your life. 

Now that you no longer labor under that particular delusion, you are met with the crushing realization that you are not in control. Or at least, not nearly as much as you thought, or as much as you want to be. 

By imaging people with depression as weak, you built yourself a reality where you must now view yourself as weak too. It isn’t a surprise that you’re finding it difficult to believe in your own value, because you built a worldview that now labels you as weak willed, worthless, expendable. With that in mind, the solution is simple, if not easy. 

You need, more than anything, to take a deeper look at what it means to be mentally ill, what it means to be depressed, and what it means to have compassion for those two groups. You need to find it in yourself to support those people, because you have realized that you are one. 

I recommend finding things written by people with depression, and other examples of people talking about what it means to live with mental illness, especially from those writing about it as they go through it instead of strictly after the fact. 

In reading and experiencing such works of other, I would hope that you could come to realize that you do feel compassion, and empathy for people going through that. I hope that you can realize that they are not weak, or worthless. I hope you would realize that they are simply people who are struggling, as you are. In improving your opinion on people who suffer from similar afflictions as you, you can begin to believe that just as they are far more than their illness, so are you. 

You can come to realize that sure, you are a person with depression, but you are also much else. You are not merely a doormat, or some sort of specter heralding misery, you are a person borne of complexity. You have worth to those around you that isn’t quantified by your ability to slap on a smile and pretend to be okay. 

In allowing others the full breadth of humanity, and truly hearing the plight of those with mental illness, you will vouchsafe for your own humanity. But most importantly, it will allow you to believe that you are worthy of compassion, capable of improvement, and a person worth keeping in the world. 

And you are.",3,2024-10-22 10:13:32

A lot of my hobbies are solo hobbies and I doubt my boyfriend would like them anyways lol. It's been hard to find things to do outside is pouring and we both don't have much money so we can't afford to do much. I would love to go to the aquarium soon but I looked up tickets and it'll be at least $100 for use to go not including the gas it'll take to get there and back. Unfortunately unless I'm at work there isn't much options for me to distract myself.

1g9dpqa,lt5c6y5,t1_lt5bfm2,quitedapperasef,Ah I’m sorry to hear that. I guess you being so busy explains the stress of wanting to fill those free moments with purposeful relaxing instead of what you see as doing nothing important. That’s understandable. I guess then it’s the little things. Trying to appreciate the little things you enjoy. And being on a budget too lol I feel that. It’s debilitating I think I understand that more than most. But honestly it’s just about finding the tiny things that keep you going and keep you engaged even for fleeting moments. When situations start to pick up you’ll feel yourself wanting more from your time and you’ll get there. It just seems like situations and circumstance are making you feel this way.,2,2024-10-22 09:49:58

Where I am, at this age you never have a car unless you're lucky and if you are going to college then you can't do more than part-time job often. Do you need a car versus a bus, is it an area without good in-city transport? And if you are graduating at 19, then you have plenty of time to figure out what you want to do and make that happen. What do you mean by alternative school?
In any case, I promise you are not late. I mean people may turn around things at any age, but as someone older- you may feel behind your peers, but trust me, in so many ways you are very young and have plenty of time to create a life you love. Besides, I don't know about the car, but 1 year until you graduate is plenty of time to seek a job if that is your aim. I promise. It's just hard right now, don't give up.",4,2024-10-22 09:31:57

It doesn’t matter what school you’re in as long as you finish. Get your diploma or GED and just focus on that. You haven’t even lived a quarter of your life yet. If you get stuck in this head space you will become what you fear you already are, and that’s what happened to me. Regardless of what you think you are you have to keep pushing. I believe in you and take things one step at a time. Focus on getting that diploma/GED first then go from there. I recommended a trade school personally, but you could easily try community college after. I finished high school then dropped out of college first year. I did trade school for a bit, but fell to drugs and was in a deep hole I dug for myself. I’ve been stuck in the same mindset you’re in and got stuck in fast food. I pushed though and even though I’m in fast food I pushed to get what I could out of the position I’m in so I moved up and am making decent money in upper management now two years sober.

I didn't get into the career I wanted at 21.  I found a different career at 25 that I never even knew existed and I really like it. I met my husband when I was 22.  I had kids at 29 and 31.  Not that all this is easy, it's not.  But you don't need to define yourself by any rules of what you're ""supposed"" to do.  You're not supposed to do anything.  Put one foot in front of the other.  Just focus on today and what you can do today.  Talk to one person - doesn't need to be a big conversation, just tiny.  I think the key is building your social muscles and social network little by little, over years. Keep your mind open. So many people around you feel the same way and need a life line.

Also - so many people who are the ""successful kids"" in high school screw their lives up later on.  I was at the grocery store a while ago and I met my high school valedictorian.  She was stocking shelves.  We talked briefly. She looked rough.  I'm guessing maybe she fell into addiction?

If you can keep to your goals even if it feels hopeless, stay in school work on yourself make connections with good people try and do that. And if it really doesn't work out remember we only have one life.

It has been one year since I was officially diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder and Generalized Anxiety disorder. I am 37, getting medically retired from the military, just got divorced, and will live with either my mother or my dad until I can figure things out. I do find myself looking back at my marriage and thinking that it was a waste of time. Therapy tells me that it was a learning phase where. Now you know what a manipulative and abusive relationship looks like. You understand what red flags to look for to stand your ground, set your boundaries, and protect yourself from any further emotional or physical harm. When we are depressed our mind plays tricks on us. We need to work harder than most to get out of that nasty mentality. Remember, you have no one but yourself to impress. If you need to live with your parents for a bit then take advantage of that time to save up, grow, and prepare yourself for the next chapter of your life.",1,2024-10-22 08:39:56

1g99gvi,lt6k7h5,t3_1g99gvi,Ritsler,"Some people have depression that arises from life events, trauma, some other negative influence, and other people are biologically predisposed to experiencing depression because of their brain chemistry. It’s sort like the nature vs. nurture debate, and some of our mental health is definitely genetic. You can also have a bit of overlap there where you’re predisposed to experiencing depressive symptoms and a life event causes you to experience a major depressive episode. 

So you basically don’t need a reason to have depression. It can just happen.",3,2024-10-22 15:01:38
1g99gvi,lt66t0c,t3_1g99gvi,lild1425,Mine also started as a teenager and therapist asked about triggers and I couldn't really come up with the usual answers and I think it's just because as a teenager we just age out of the blissfully ignorant puppy dog years and start to grasp all the bullshit.

1g99gvi,lt4hxzq,t3_1g99gvi,Ihavenomouth42,"Honestly, I can't say. With how long mine now that Im looking back and analyzing my feelings and moods... even when my dad wasn't being verbally abusive and everything was fine... ive always had a compulsion to just be done. Everything can be going absolutely amazing and it's still waking up and there's that voice ""Fuck we woke up"" or while driving and seeing a telephone pole ""we could give that pole a vehicle hug, it looks lonely!!!"" Just constantly. Because Honestly on the daily no we shouldn't have these thoughts daily in my case, but I've seen others post that it's the same. I don't have advice, because I waited 34 years to seek actual help. So coming to terms this is new to me. But I think it's a healthy sign that you are questioning this and looking for answers. It means to me you are going ""This isn't normal"" and actually reaching out. Whether you decide on medication to help or learning new skills to help, it will all help IMO. My mind was strong enough that I had 21 years between attempts. And both times I was lucky that someone answered I wish I wouldn't have listened to anybody and gotten the help, because maybe I would have gone from looking at those 21 years as bonus years to I saved my life.... because now I dont know what to call every day now. Maybe after counseling I can think of it as saving my life. 

So be strong in recognizing the strength you have in questioning what's going on, and saying something.

Also I had trouble finding a counselor and right when I felt like all hope was gone and I was slowly running out of steam. I got the best counselor I think I could have, who's letting me talk and listening, it feels like I have someone who understands what I am saying. I hope you can find a counselor who makes you feel that way. Because my happiest days are appointment days now, from what I see on my mood tracker.",2,2024-10-22 04:27:14
1g99gvi,lt5hibz,t3_1g99gvi,drgonzo4321,"I feel the same way. For me, it all started with school, especially high school, where you’re forced to adapt to the system. Looking back on my childhood, it was pretty good. I can’t really remember anything particularly bad.

Then, at some point, if you hit a crisis, they give you the label of depression. But there’s no real proof of a cause, or even that you have depression. They just say that some neurotransmitters in your brain are out of balance or something is missing. Then they treat you with antidepressants. But do they actually measure whether anything in your brain changes? No. I think that’s mysterious point number one.

The second point is that every mental illness needs someone to diagnose it in the first place. Once a psychiatrist labels you with depression, the next one just builds on that, and your ""mental health career"" begins. But there was never any physical evidence of what your actual illness is.

In the end, maybe you could live quite well, but because they treat you as mentally ill, you start to question everything.

It’s a complex topic, and I’m not saying there’s no such thing as mental illness, but it’s hard for me to analyze when it all started or whether it really matters at this point.",2,2024-10-22 10:44:41

I really feel like it doesn't help me get better in therapy because I really don't know what to fix to get better.

1g990va,lt4fkdi,t3_1g990va,SimileQuotes,"Hey girl, it’s okay to feel like a  let down. You are allowed to have days where you don’t feel at your best. 

You are not a bad person for feeling ungrateful or sad about your pregnancy. You are allowed to have mixed feelings, feel like something is wrong with yourself, it’s something a LOT of pregnant woman go through. 

The prisoner bit I understand, feeling stuck in your body and mind, having to go through the changes without moving. Feeling powerless basically. My advice would be to give yourself more control, find a something that will make you gain that level of power and decision making. An activity that will bring you that sense of power to regain your voice. 

Journaling helps, especially if nobody wants to listen. I also say, why not record yourself or talk to the baby? Hey buddy.. I’m having a bad day because… talk to him, even if he is in your belly, just do it whenever you feel lonely and want someone to lend an ear. 

Also, do read some pregnancy posts, I’m sure you aren’t the only one feeling stuck with a baby.  There are ressources available if all you want is to talk, that may be specialized in pregnant woman. But I might be wrong on that. 

Anyway, you aren’t really alone in this; baby is here too. In the sense that, he is here for you too. And you may not see it now but, maybe by focusing on him(idk the gender so I just used masculine) you’ll find new meaning to your life. 

Becoming a mother is a scary step, fucking terrifying, I’m sure that’s one of the reasons you feel so powerless and out of your mind right now, but nobody is asking you to become the best mom, or the greatest person. 

Just be you; even if that means crying yourself out on a bathroom hoping the baby comes sooner rather than later. 

I also wanted to add that.. while you might feel at your shittiest right now, that baby isn’t coming out of your body right as we speak, so focus on the present moment and make yourself smile with something. 

Find something that makes feel you just a little bit less trapped, and a little more free. It can be clothes, food, hobbies, music, whatever. Just make sure you are comfortable, your basics needs are taken cared of, the rest will come in time. 

And yes this moment is scary, but there are always good sides to a story. Find the good, and switch the focus from bad to a little less bad. 

And yes there is help for you, there is always help for those who seek it. Your situation can get better, and your pregnancy can become a good thing in your life. 

I know my words aren’t going to solve your problem, and they may even frustrate you, but I hope it helped a little. 

Don’t give up on yourself, forgive yourself for tonight it’s okay. You can do better, and you are allowed to make mistakes and feel awful. Do it for yourself! 

Good luck!",1,2024-10-22 04:07:32

Maybe taking an active step every day is the way to do it. Tbh idk. But dwelling on how much your life sucks makes it suck even more, I’ll tell you that. 

It’s okay to feel down, depressed, out of it. It’s a valid feeling, and your life makes you feel trapped in time, so… I understand. 

Maybe facing how you are feeling will help, like writing it down somewhere and forgiving yourself for thinking that. Accept that you are sad and feel bad, and find something that will make you just a little less awful about yourself. It can be anything, just as long as you make sure it helps.

Life can be so difficult to endure.

Though  I hate hearing it when I am in that place, try to take a breath and realize your depression is casting a negative light on everything.  Sometimes that helps me.  A reminder to breathe and have patience.

Try to accept you are at the suck-y place you are, but still have the future to change things.  At least believe maybe it won’t always be this bad, and you have the power to change things.

I hate that you are in so much pain.  I know that pain.

Give yourself the space and the time to heal. Forgive yourself for your shortcomings, reward yourself when you do something that takes a lot of energy. Find something that makes you smile. And don’t focus on tomorrow but the present. 

What do you feel? What can you smell? What can you touch? What are you looking at? Those questions can help make you snap out of that existential limpness of seeing your life play out without moving. 

Change environnements and allow yourself to be someone else for a few seconds. You are reinvent yourself, choose a new smile, a new style, a new walk. I am saying that, as it may help you get away from the I am depressed and that is my personality. 

Talk to people, doesn’t mean overshare or making jokes. Just interact with people. 

And help others, it can really boost your morale and make you feel like you have a purpose. Not feeling positive about yourself is alright. But feeling alright about a few things is alright too. 

You can like a few things, you can hate a few others, doesn’t mean you aren’t worth it. 

Anyway, I am struggling with depression myself, I know sometimes you can’t help it, it’s like a default setting and you just get stuck. In the case that I am in the bed not moving and basically just existing, I try to move a finger or a toe, and then an ankle or a wrist and slowly move my whole body until I can feel things again. 

Start slow and move at your own pace, nobody is comparing your growth to any one. You are allowed to go at your own rhythm. And if you take a few steps back, it’s okay, the next step forward can be small, it’s the effort that counts not the distance.

Sometimes it feels like I’m letting my life play out while not actively playing a role in it. I’m just there watching, waiting for something. 

What helps me is concentrating on the room and my environnement, start focusing on the details of how my senses feel. Like what do I smell, what do I touch? Etc. It snaps me out of the « what I my doing here » then, I have to go take a walk outside and not be in complete silence, where I need to just focus on other people than myself. 

Tbh, switching focus helps a lot, like I know I just get madly into something whenever I feel bad about myself. 

My advice would be: do something fun. I know it sounds stupid but it’s true, do something you might enjoy mildly, and try to find something that makes you smile. And try again and again until you find it. 

Life isn’t just about having a job, finding a partner, building a family or even making money. It’s about whatever you decide you make of it. And that’s scary af. So just focus on the present, the right now. Not tomorrow not in a hour, just now. 

So if you just want to cry do it, if you just want to eat do it, but also, watch that funny reel, or read the book you said you wanted to start, check out that new shop in town. 

And if that’s still doesn’t work, I found focusing on other people’s struggles helps. Helping someone is actually helping me. Give yourself the goal to help 1 person that day, and I’m sure you’ll feel just a little bit better afterwards. 

And if it still doesn’t work, forgive yourself too. You are allowed to feel like shit, to fail at everything (I don’t actually know your life so I’m just taking this as an example), you’re allowed to be mediocre and bad (well depends on your country’s laws for sure) but yeah forgive yourself that day and start again. 

It’s okay to give up, to take a pause, to breathe and just stay still. But if there is only a 0,0001% chance you want to find a little more happiness, give yourself the space and the time to do it. 

It’s not instant by the way, it will hurt like hell, but better this than what you’re feeling right now right? 

From my own experience, I’ve had suicidal ideations, even an attempt. And I know how it’s like. The sort of dark feeling where life is basically all black and grey, and you’re constantly on the verge of either crying or running to get K by a car. 

I get it. Nobody is perfect, and your life is hell, you hate your body, your friends, your family, your job, you just want to quit everything. 

Sure. 

But there are other ways to find peace. Death isn’t the only choice. And Life might have a few things to offer you haven’t considered yet.

1g91wza,lt3vkhx,t3_1g91wza,SimileQuotes,"No I get it.

I mean I do feel similar to a certain extent. I’ve had suicidal ideation/ thoughts for almost 10 years now, (I’m 24F), and had to struggle with both social anxiety and depression. 

My parents found out, was hospitalized for a few weeks, had therapy for years, been on meds for years, had dozens of consultations with different doctors, I’m still not fully recovered, and I do still want to k myself sometimes. 

Tbh the only thing that kept me going was my family, I felt bad knowing they loved me and didn’t want me to leave (we had those conversations). Probably saved me too. 

But I have to say, I did have some great times that I am grateful for, times I wouldn’t have gotten to experience had I done it. It didn’t happen instantly, it took some time, and some work on myself. It also comes down to how you approach these moments. 

To me, my depression was always linked to my emotions, how deeply I felt everything. I had been bullied for my whole childhood, plus High School, and was literally the most « hated » and « annoying » person according to most people I hanged out with. Even the few friends I had made were fed up with me, and would often say it was hard being my friend because I was just so « intense ». (I am not autistic, nor have ADHD, or any known disorder other than anxiety) I just get very socially awkward, and too much to the point where people are tired of my presence. 

Anyway, I just want to say that, I understand the feeling, and I think it’s valid, you’re allowed to feel like shit, and like the world isn’t for you, you aren’t alone in that. 

And you don’t see a future, that’s fine, not projecting yourself further is okay. 

Now my but is here, before you go, or before you plan on going, maybe try to finish it doing something you like, write the damn book, go on the trip, meet the people, have sex! Idk what you’re into, just do the things you might miss, or the things that make you mildly happy. And then, if you feel good doing them, and want to continue to live, well guess what… you can. And if you still feel like the biggest piece of shit on earth, you can try again until you find happiness before dying. 

Just find what makes you smile today, not tomorrow, not in an hour, right this second. And do it. 

Anyway that’s my two cents. And yeah, I’d rather you not die, but I don’t know you personally, and you don’t know me. But I see you and I feel for you. The pain you have, I have it too, and if I can just make you smile, then maybe I didn’t write a fucking thousand word for nothing. 

———————————

And here are the ways I found some semblance of happiness:
- Make new friends (just talking to people, not actually becoming great friends but having interactions) 
- Read things that make me happy 
- Accept my feelings as valid and write down whenever I feel bad, but also forgive myself for not taking care of my body (like when I really don’t have the energy to go brush my teeth) 
- Get out of my bed to walk and then reward myself with McDonalds because I finally got out.
- say yes to things more often (wanna go out? Yes. Wanna do this? Yes) 
- dress comfortably 
- stop focusing on how people perceive me, but rather how I feel right now.
- having a dog helps, they love you so much, and without a doubt or reason
- do the things I was scared of doing. I used to be scared of starting new things because I wanted to be good/great at them from the start. Now I just don’t care, because I assume it’s going to be shit at first. 
- limit certain self-harming behaviours.
- start to put a : hey it’s okay mentality.
- forgive yourself for your shortcomings and understand you have limits and boundaries. 

Hope it helped, and Good luck!",2,2024-10-22 01:52:09

Hobbies (incl. passions) are important and I think when addressing depression from the lifestyle angle it’s a super important part of it alongside diet, exercise, sunshine, social interaction etc etc. 

But equally it can be the most frustrating advice to receive because it just makes you feel further removed from “normal” minds/people. 

I have a lot of ideas of hobbies I’m interested in and I know I have enjoyed them in the past when I’ve tried them here and there and I would like them to become hobbies of mine but my issue is I struggle with enjoying things sometimes, I struggle with motivation, I struggle with energy levels and I struggle to do the bare minimum of life sometimes and so the idea of adding a hobby several times a week is daunting and exhausting. 

But if someone is telling you this I would think it’s from a place of caring, so perhaps just be mindful how you react to that advice. You don’t have to take it on board, just feel nice that someone is trying to offer help.",0,2024-10-22 01:57:45

Perhaps consult with your primary dictor and psychiatrist if you have one about taking medications to help you get more enjoyment out of your life.  Be careful with anti depressants though as some of them can be sedating and mess with the quality of your sleep.

Most of us still have lives. Sure there's plenty of people whose suffering causes isolation, but assuming everyone does can really harm those who still try! It's like telling us what we DO do to keep busy and sane isn't acceptable or enough.

Sometimes a miserable life and depression go together, sometimes they don’t.  
People can have torturous lives … literally (like being prisoners and such) yet still have a strong will to live.  People can have great lives … enough money, living family, career success, whatever … and crave death.  

Depression is-what-it-is.  It’s mysterious and horrible.

1g8zh0r,lt4emhx,t3_1g8zh0r,StragglingShadow,"Hey mate. I want to let you know that I have been in a very similar place when I was your age. I'm now an adult, and I've found the right combination of medicine and therapy for me. I can't promise you that life will get better. Only you can do stuff to make it potentially better. But I can promise you that if you hold on, life will change. Sometimes, the change is neutral. Sometimes it's only a little good and you are like, ""That's it? That's all the nice I get after all that bad?"" But in the end, it's always going to be changing. And because it's always changing, that means you too can find the right things to make you feel better. Hell, sometimes I feel downright GOOD. I almost never felt GOOD at your age. I didn't think it was possible for me to feel this way. But I held on anyways. And damnit, life changed as a result.




Hang on. At 17, you haven't gotten to make any choices for yourself that mattered. At 18 and beyond, your life is in YOUR hands. YOU can MAKE it change. You can make it BETTER. Here is my advice to help make it better: 



1. Get you some therapy as soon as you get a job and get some health insurance. There's a reason people are avoiding you and therapy is gonna help you figure that shit out. They'll help you get some confidence too. You seem to bully yourself a lot. 



2. Stop smoking weed. I'm not against weed. I'm totally for it. But when you are an adult. Studies show minors smoking weed stunts their mental growth. Do yourself a favor and cease smoking until 21. It's also a depressant, so you might find that after your withdrawl ends (if you were a heavy smoker. If you were a casual smoker you'll be fine no problems) you feel slightly better as a baseline. 



3. Take a little morning walk. Doesn't need to be far. Around the block is fine. 5 minutes. It just has to be every day. The sunshine, movement, and routine helps a little. 




4. Your managers are assholes for yelling at a kid. There's something wrong with them. Not you. Remember that. 



5. Finally, you don't need to know what you want to do in life immediately. All you need is a 5 year plan that is feasible. For now, it should be finding a job that you like and doesn't yell at you. If pizza isn't your forte, try something else. To be a janitor, all you need to do is know how to sweep and mop, and be 18. That's literally it. They'll teach you the rest. And it's very solitary, if people aren't your thing. There's also stuff like plumbing or electricians, where you apprentice for a bit and learn on the job. if that's how you learn better than books, then jobs like that are a great pick instead of college. Think about the things you want in a job - like ""I want to not interact with people if possible"" or ""I want to work at a desk"" - that are important to you. Then, look into jobs that have the majority of what you want and as little of what you dislike as possible. 




You have so much potential. Don't let some loser pizza manager think otherwise. Don't let your parents make you think family feels bad. You can choose to not talk to them once you are out of their house. You can find a better family. Found family is phenomenal. Way better than blood family in my experience. Give yourself a fighting chance by holding on long enough for life to change.",2,2024-10-22 04:00:01

I graduated high school unfortunately - It's 4 A.M. right now where I'm at, and have no idea what I'm doing up right now. I guess I felt the same way as you had the same scenario at 17 - Not I am hypothetically speaking about what is rare what is going throigh your mind right now, but I see the phases of you analyzing your life right now. It's crucial, brutal, and containing agony. On the side note: I'm surprised you have a job and proud of you. I can't even work at a small local retail store. Your coworkers that seemed intense were yelling at you for what so called, 'bad delivery service' is plain wrong, for an irony twist; they're basically withdrawing you from their involvement in the situation. 


It's completely chaos for a divided workplace in a small town. Every time I hear small town, just reminds me the same rountine moment I had with encounters that casually insults me for whatever reasons that it's them exaggerating the scene I made, even if it wasn't a big deal. 




In all hopes man, I'm rooting for you. You've still got time left. The fact you've lost your mother and still had confidently spoke publicly on this site is surprisely amazing (I'm sorry for you loss by the way). 


I personally get scared to talk about my problems about my emotional abuse relationship right now with my single mother. (Not allowed to get into details)

Look at the past, look at your mistakes, look at your family and ask yourself ""what happened? Why is everything ""wrong""? 

The obvious answer for you would be that it's your fault, but you're just a teenager. Teenagers are stupid and naive, and you don't deserve to die at such a young age, no one does. 

Even if the fuel is low you need to accelerate as fast as possible to reach the gas station, and when you're there I assure you all your problems will be gone (at least the majority). 

No accomplishments? No good job? A ""failure"" for your parents? Who gives a shit? 

Life is YOURS, not of someone else. You decide what is good for you, even if it is objectively bad. 

You have a shit job but you're young and you have so many possibilities. Please put all your maximum efforts in high school and be the person you fucking wanted to be since you were a kid. Hell yea, you need to actually have fun and like what you do mate. 

In my honest opinion your mom wouldn't want to see you so soon (in a good way). I am very, very sure that if she was alive she would literally put herself in front of you to stop you from doing such a thing. 

You're not wrong, you're not the extra unwanted piece in the puzzle. Everything else is wrong for making you think you're wrong, and never, ever think that you're abnormal or something. We're humans, not machines.

Maybe there’s a way  to end the current life you have without depriving yourself the opportunity to live all together, big lifestyle change? You don’t have to live a “good” life, sometimes just living is enough. If you can find anything to look forward to (even something stupid, tv shows help me a lot) or anything to live for then take the chance. You don’t have to make this decision right now. You can stop it all at any point, I think you might as well hold out for longer. It sounds like a lot of people around you kind of suck. If you can keep going just to spite them please do. I don’t know if this will help at all but it’s what I tell myself.

And I hated them. 

I'm just a random stranger to you, but let me say I'm not disappointed in you for trying to alleviate pain, escape or help yourself in anyway. You're struggling and you used weed, nothing fundamentally wrong with the concept behind your actions, I won't discuss if it's right or wrong. 

Your family seems to be a big part of what you're struggling with. Understandable. 

You can be selfish, you can not have ""achievements"" and I know that's bothering you. But that's not really true, I see your everyday is an achievement, working while studying while having pressures from family. You're the opposite of what a loser is.

I didn't talk about school alot since its not important, I do online so I can work and get more money, but I think this is part of the issue because I'm so deathly awkward and quiet now, all I do is listen to music and daydream. Everyday. I just can't stand to he around people because they're all so fake to me.

As for the cannabis thing, I've been smoking for nearly three years now? They had found out just yesterday but I feel like they suspected for a while now too, but they just couldn't belive their awkward lame daughter to do any sort of drugs which is why they never even confronted me. I was threatened to have the cops on me, and that made me realize I genuinely have nobody.

They're done with me after I'm 18, they only care now because they have to.

life is similar to a rollercoaster, both have lows and highs and you need to experience the lows in order to experience the highs. you're in a low now, but that also means you're about the experience a high. stay in there and keep persevering, these struggles make you a stronger person and they are happening for a reason, even if that reason isn't known to you yet😁",2,2024-10-21 19:50:56

I may not know you…our experiences are different and I can’t say I know exactly how you’re feeling, but I’m so thankful you are here another day.

I hope you keep sharing your story on here when things get dark—there will always be someone on here who says they’ve felt something similar, maybe they’re feeling it right now, or maybe they have some words of encouragement after coming out of that time in their lives.

Whenever it gets really dark or painful for me, I try to remind myself that what I’m feeling or experiencing won’t last forever—it will change and I will get through it, and there will be something waiting for me to smile, laugh, and love. Just not today.

I almost ended my life in 2015–I couldn’t see anything but a void and I was so empty. Somehow, someone found me in the right time and I ended up getting help and support from family. It took years for me to feel whole again from that, but each day something small would change and it would be enough to keep going.

When I lost two of my friends to suicide, I think that’s what opened me up the most. I saw their pain and kept thinking about what I wanted to say to them so they would hang on just a while longer—that maybe a week or month from that day, something would change for them, too, and I could be there with them so they didn’t have to face it alone. That ended up being a letter to my younger self in a way…and even though the loss will always be there, I hope I can keep sharing so someone hears what I needed to hear 9 years ago.

I hope you continue to live another day and take it one day at a time, giving yourself grace when the low valleys come, and that you’ll find peace and encouragement from someone in your life when it feels unbearable. I hope when guilt or shame or defeat knock at your door, that you remind them you are a person and it’s okay to feel this way—there are so many people who do every day.

I will say, in most cases, if you were to see a therapist, they'd tell you to journal. Write out why you're feeling the way you are, or what's going on that you think might be contributing to your current mental state.

For me, the closest i came to ending it, was to drive into a hedge of trees at +70mph, because my ex had mentally abused me so badly that i couldn't take it anymore... but then i have 3 kids and i realized that no matter how much i hurt, how much i suffer, I will be here to love and watch my kids grow.

Sometimes it is helps to let your family know (assuming they're very loving), or your friends (which, unfortunately, will show you how much they value you as a friend).

  
What i will say is to just take it one day at a time. You woke up feeling better, but are still lost? that's still much better than waking up empty and lost.

The lecturer had 1 call with me, explained the situation plainly that 2nd thesis defense is scheduled in 4 days and kept in check with my process daily just to make sure that I won't rebound into distress.

All in all, I never received this basic skill of seeing something through by daily labor or fortitude to deal with bigger than daily problems, however, this one act of kindness proved me that if you are willing to go an extra mile by throwing yourself into the arms of someone competent to help you, they will most likely do indeed help.

Another thing I noticed is that noone actually cares that much, but there is a pretty simple scheme:

It may help you to feel better to take some proactive steps in regard to your job. Just in case you did get laid off. Dust off the resume and update it. Same with the LinkedIn profile. Establish/re-establish any professional references. 

With regards to your boyfriend, if you have not already, you two should spend some time setting up expectations for each other for whatever chores there are around the house/apartment. If you two haven’t been out in while spending time together, maybe it’s time to change that. 

Stop living to for your mother and live for yourself. 

You do not have to do everything all other once. Set small goals and tasks and do one.

When I was in the ‘seemingly endless horrible’ state, I’d sometimes focus on all the things I hated.  Then try to find one thing to change or get rid of.  Instead of any hopes for happiness, a little ‘absence of pain’ seemed possible.  

When you feel like absolute crap, a little-less-crappy can be a relief.

I was in therapy, which didn’t help. The cliche things people suggest can be super annoying.

But the last few years were relativly good for me. Had a good group therapy going and I managed to finish it. I kept some friends and felt ready to get back to work and engage with people again. 

Now my wife and I are getting a divorce and I feel myself teetering on the edge again. A new down. Shit...

I know, however, that an up is coming after the dust settles. In the meantime I do what I can to help myself. And when I can't, well, there's booze to get me through the night.

There is a silver lining though. Through all this, I've reconnected with my family and they're kinder than they ever were.

I guess my response is not as positive as you may have wanted, but I guess I wanted to share that there's good things in the bad times; and even if the good times aren't like fireworks, there might still be a more subtle contentment to find.",2,2024-10-21 14:30:32

Sorry about your divorce. Sometimes i lament myself about my complete failure when it comes to relationship but if I were to meet someone it would probably end like this.

You re right that family is important, but I always feel like i have nothing to share except sadness or just playing a game of pretend with them, so I end never reaching them. I'll probably regret that later",1,2024-10-21 17:05:17
1g8n34i,lszokln,t3_1g8n34i,BuddyApprehensive958,"Well what I’ve heard is often people who have depression struggle with motivation(like you mentioned) due to their loss of desire,hope, or happiness. While it could be a sign of depression it also can be a symptom of other things like adhd or maybe a neurodivergent mind. I think the more telltale sign of depression is the inability to do very simple tasks like getting out of bed or simply move out of your room. It deals with a more complete loss of motivation rather than maybe a slight loss of motivation. Although I’d say it’s better to trust whatever the psychiatrist says. Try to look for moments where you feel something off from normal and try to communicate that to your psychiatrist.",2,2024-10-21 11:41:56

Every time I try to work towards fixing this problem I get a small peak with my feelings but I fail to continually work towards the goal and my baseline feeling drops lower. In the flat baseline feeling I honestly just continue following  my addictions even though they feel empty. While in the end I’m just making excuses, I know deep down that I could be happier if I worked but my spiralling mood just makes it harder and harder to start. I’d say it’s a good thing to maintain discipline and not let your desires or instant gratification control you, and while it might feel draining and bleak at times at least you can be somewhat happy and fulfilled because you are working toward your goals.",1,2024-10-21 11:53:08

Even when you're striving for something. My desires become empty when I try and siphon every last bit of joy from it. You would think that's a positive. 

The opposite. It's desperation and the acts themselves become nothing but cannon fodder. White noise.

I don't want to let it go... Even if I have too. It's like this  attachment. 

It's a weird balance. Because if the addiction or even positive activity gives you something. It could put you in the headspace for another path

Like yes, a depressed person will become suicidal that’s literally the illness but they make you feel weird for having symptoms of your illness. There’s so much pressure to be a high functioning depressive and as soon as you start exhibiting the worse, more debilitating symptoms suddenly people don’t have room for that. Only if you’re depressed but still functioning do people have sympathy for you. I really feel for your situation, and I’m sorry your friends are no support to you. I’m also pretty isolated and the only person I really have who hears me out and understands me is my mom, so I get it.

Leave the ball in her court and give her time and space to think. More likely than not- she’ll feel more betrayed by her stepmom and maybe even come to you for comfort. Don’t take advantage of that or see it as forgiveness though. Absolutely think out the wording you choose as well. In no way do you want her to feel as though you’re blaming her for your behavior.

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

The days of “original” stuff is gone. Everything now is cut more than minced garlic. Be careful. I’ve lost so many friends. Too much cut in one batch this time and the next time not and they didn’t figure that out until they were choking on their vomit in their car, lying on their couch telling their girlfriend what they took doesn’t feel like Xanax, then going into a seizure and cardiac arrest, or simply having a heart attack by the dumpster at their halfway house 1000 miles away from home.

It’s devastating what happens to parents, friends and family who love you when you’re gone. Some move on, but many carry the pain of feeling like they could have done more to save you and are haunted by that indefinitely. I’ve seen parents cancel their phone numbers, stop going outside, stop going to church, fall into depression and others even into dementia. Whatever you’re going through, you will get through.

Life is full of ups and downs and sometimes the downs go on longer than we feel we can handle, but you would be surprised what you can survive if you simply believe the good will come back around…it will.

You wake up and choose to love someone even through hard times. All the reasons you’ve already listed in here are extremely selfish “don’t want to hurt my wife’s feelings, don’t want to lose my kids, scared the step mom is going to tell her first…” Understand that you’ve already broken your wife’s heart she just doesn’t know it yet, and based off how you plan on taking action it seems she’ll be the last to know. 

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad. You don’t regret it like you say you do just sounds like you regret the repercussions that’ll follow. Tell her and stop being a coward.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Just take it slow and trust that if you put in the work and take the suggestions of your therapist, you have nothing to lose but you very thing to gain: especially your life back. Problems all have solutions, sometimes it just takes a while to figure out what the solution is. And sometimes having another person to talk to who knows more than we do about these things can help us find those solutions. Good luck in your journey and please keep us updated.

But yeah at one time I'd wake up take sleeping pills and go back to sleep , play sick so I wouldn't have to get out of bed at all and use it when finally texting people back ,. Never did the crazy pills ( no disrespect to you ) or psycho doctor. ( No disrespect to you ) The thought of thinking a person that doesn't know me , no emotional tie to me , wants me to break down to my lowest self in front of them and pay them to do it, a person really not listening or understanding but looking for key words or statements to match up for their  reaction to me from her little books they've memorized and truly doesn't care after my time runs out on their clock just always sounded stupid , pointless and a complete waste of time to me . 

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me . Perfect perfect perfect setting for what I was doing . Furthest I had to go was to my mailbox , like literally. 

What got my stupid ass out of bed was id laid in bed for so long my back started killing me so I had to get up . I came to the conclusion that laying in bed or not , nothing changes , only thing that changed was my back was now feeling like my spine is ripping out my flesh 🤷🏼‍♂️ but everything else was still the same . Being in that bed didn't change anything. 

And eventually you're going to have to get up anyways by choice or by force like my back . My health change yeah , body got weaker muscles got weaker and living ever day battling the bullshit ( depression) you definitely need somewhat of your physical strength because thats a heavy thing to carry around everyday.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Don’t take advantage of that or see it as forgiveness though. Absolutely think out the wording you choose as well. In no way do you want her to feel as though you’re blaming her for your behavior.

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

I can too listen to the same music artist for weeks or even months in a row.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

Never did the crazy pills ( no disrespect to you ) or psycho doctor. ( No disrespect to you ) The thought of thinking a person that doesn't know me , no emotional tie to me , wants me to break down to my lowest self in front of them and pay them to do it, a person really not listening or understanding but looking for key words or statements to match up for their  reaction to me from her little books they've memorized and truly doesn't care after my time runs out on their clock just always sounded stupid , pointless and a complete waste of time to me . 

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me . Perfect perfect perfect setting for what I was doing . Furthest I had to go was to my mailbox , like literally. 

What got my stupid ass out of bed was id laid in bed for so long my back started killing me so I had to get up . I came to the conclusion that laying in bed or not , nothing changes , only thing that changed was my back was now feeling like my spine is ripping out my flesh 🤷🏼‍♂️ but everything else was still the same . Being in that bed didn't change anything. 

And eventually you're going to have to get up anyways by choice or by force like my back . My health change yeah , body got weaker muscles got weaker and living ever day battling the bullshit ( depression) you definitely need somewhat of your physical strength because thats a heavy thing to carry around everyday.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Like yes, a depressed person will become suicidal that’s literally the illness but they make you feel weird for having symptoms of your illness. There’s so much pressure to be a high functioning depressive and as soon as you start exhibiting the worse, more debilitating symptoms suddenly people don’t have room for that. Only if you’re depressed but still functioning do people have sympathy for you. I really feel for your situation, and I’m sorry your friends are no support to you. I’m also pretty isolated and the only person I really have who hears me out and understands me is my mom, so I get it.

Leave the ball in her court and give her time and space to think. More likely than not- she’ll feel more betrayed by her stepmom and maybe even come to you for comfort. Don’t take advantage of that or see it as forgiveness though. Absolutely think out the wording you choose as well. In no way do you want her to feel as though you’re blaming her for your behavior.

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad. You don’t regret it like you say you do just sounds like you regret the repercussions that’ll follow. Tell her and stop being a coward.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason. Despite the 1000s counterarguments of why it shouldn't work. But nobody else can do it for you, just you",3,2024-10-21 06:35:31

1g8ddpc,lsy2vld,t1_lsxteb4,PuffTrain,"To be fair, having both trained as a therapist, been to therapy myself, and been kicked out of a session (I had admitted to smoking weed and she said I can't be high during my session), I think it depends. 

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

It may feel good in the moment, anger is a very strong drug, but trust me, it can take you too a place you dont wanna go, because deep down you are crushing your own soul and you get filled with regret and disgust on what you have become and guess what, you will blame them for it too. Rinse and repeat. You will become a hate filled disgusting excuse for a human being, because people have wronged you. So eventually these same people who hurt you, let you destroy yourself. 


When you are stuck in that cycle man, its very difficult too get out. 


The most healthy thing you can do is take this as a lesson for yourself and let them be them, because you can fantasise all you want, nothing is gonna happen too them because you fantasied about it. If you keep doing this, they will keep control over you and thats all on you in the end, no one else.

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me .

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Rinse and repeat. You will become a hate filled disgusting excuse for a human being, because people have wronged you. So eventually these same people who hurt you, let you destroy yourself. 


When you are stuck in that cycle man, its very difficult too get out. 


The most healthy thing you can do is take this as a lesson for yourself and let them be them, because you can fantasise all you want, nothing is gonna happen too them because you fantasied about it.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason. Despite the 1000s counterarguments of why it shouldn't work. But nobody else can do it for you, just you",3,2024-10-21 06:35:31

1g8ddpc,lsy2vld,t1_lsxteb4,PuffTrain,"To be fair, having both trained as a therapist, been to therapy myself, and been kicked out of a session (I had admitted to smoking weed and she said I can't be high during my session), I think it depends. 

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

But the same can also be said in the other direction, in some other life I never made it this far, maybe had it worse, but knowing that isn’t a pleasant thought.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason. Despite the 1000s counterarguments of why it shouldn't work. But nobody else can do it for you, just you",3,2024-10-21 06:35:31

1g8ddpc,lsy2vld,t1_lsxteb4,PuffTrain,"To be fair, having both trained as a therapist, been to therapy myself, and been kicked out of a session (I had admitted to smoking weed and she said I can't be high during my session), I think it depends. 

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

1g8gcqb,ltoevab,t3_1g8gcqb,throwaway48390483884,"I think you need to understand that you saying you love your wife is not helping neither her or you. Love is a conscious choice, not a feeling. You wake up and choose to love someone even through hard times. All the reasons you’ve already listed in here are extremely selfish “don’t want to hurt my wife’s feelings, don’t want to lose my kids, scared the step mom is going to tell her first…” Understand that you’ve already broken your wife’s heart she just doesn’t know it yet, and based off how you plan on taking action it seems she’ll be the last to know. 

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad. You don’t regret it like you say you do just sounds like you regret the repercussions that’ll follow. Tell her and stop being a coward.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason. Despite the 1000s counterarguments of why it shouldn't work. But nobody else can do it for you, just you",3,2024-10-21 06:35:31

1g8ddpc,lsy2vld,t1_lsxteb4,PuffTrain,"To be fair, having both trained as a therapist, been to therapy myself, and been kicked out of a session (I had admitted to smoking weed and she said I can't be high during my session), I think it depends. 

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

1g8gcqb,lsyoxun,t3_1g8gcqb,blueberry29_1,If you have any respect for her you’ll come clean. Don’t go into it expecting forgiveness though. Leave the ball in her court and give her time and space to think. More likely than not- she’ll feel more betrayed by her stepmom and maybe even come to you for comfort. Don’t take advantage of that or see it as forgiveness though. Absolutely think out the wording you choose as well. In no way do you want her to feel as though you’re blaming her for your behavior.

You wake up and choose to love someone even through hard times. All the reasons you’ve already listed in here are extremely selfish “don’t want to hurt my wife’s feelings, don’t want to lose my kids, scared the step mom is going to tell her first…” Understand that you’ve already broken your wife’s heart she just doesn’t know it yet, and based off how you plan on taking action it seems she’ll be the last to know. 

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad. You don’t regret it like you say you do just sounds like you regret the repercussions that’ll follow. Tell her and stop being a coward.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

Being in that bed didn't change anything. 

And eventually you're going to have to get up anyways by choice or by force like my back . My health change yeah , body got weaker muscles got weaker and living ever day battling the bullshit ( depression) you definitely need somewhat of your physical strength because thats a heavy thing to carry around everyday.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.


Negativity is what fuels depression. So we should try to avoid anything that causes negative response in our brain. ",5,2024-10-21 12:29:48

Depression is a beast of an illness and they don’t have the answers, unfortunately in my experience there’s no real substantial thing that even therapists who are charged with caring for us as mental health patients can say to make us “feel better”. Depression doesn’t give a shit whether you have a roof over your head and all that, and telling someone to be grateful for it undermines the complete decay this illness can cause.",3,2024-10-21 20:34:36

And in the end, it helped. 

You have to try out what will help you. But it still involves getting out of your comfort zone and following suggestions from your therapist even though they seem dumb to you.

My main sorrows surround the fear of my elderly mother dying and me losing my childhood home and I am also more and more concerned because of health issues that keep me from enjoying my life. Related to my health concerns and the depression and anxiety is also the fear of not being able to go on working in my job and losing my existence at some point. All those thoughts give me very bad insomnia that makes everything worse.

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.

Never did the crazy pills ( no disrespect to you ) or psycho doctor. ( No disrespect to you ) The thought of thinking a person that doesn't know me , no emotional tie to me , wants me to break down to my lowest self in front of them and pay them to do it, a person really not listening or understanding but looking for key words or statements to match up for their  reaction to me from her little books they've memorized and truly doesn't care after my time runs out on their clock just always sounded stupid , pointless and a complete waste of time to me . 

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me .

What got my stupid ass out of bed was id laid in bed for so long my back started killing me so I had to get up . I came to the conclusion that laying in bed or not , nothing changes , only thing that changed was my back was now feeling like my spine is ripping out my flesh 🤷🏼‍♂️ but everything else was still the same . Being in that bed didn't change anything. 

And eventually you're going to have to get up anyways by choice or by force like my back . My health change yeah , body got weaker muscles got weaker and living ever day battling the bullshit ( depression) you definitely need somewhat of your physical strength because thats a heavy thing to carry around everyday.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

I can too listen to the same music artist for weeks or even months in a row.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

It may feel good in the moment, anger is a very strong drug, but trust me, it can take you too a place you dont wanna go, because deep down you are crushing your own soul and you get filled with regret and disgust on what you have become and guess what, you will blame them for it too. Rinse and repeat. You will become a hate filled disgusting excuse for a human being, because people have wronged you. So eventually these same people who hurt you, let you destroy yourself. 


When you are stuck in that cycle man, its very difficult too get out. 


The most healthy thing you can do is take this as a lesson for yourself and let them be them, because you can fantasise all you want, nothing is gonna happen too them because you fantasied about it. If you keep doing this, they will keep control over you and thats all on you in the end, no one else.

Never did the crazy pills ( no disrespect to you ) or psycho doctor.

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me .

What got my stupid ass out of bed was id laid in bed for so long my back started killing me so I had to get up .

Being in that bed didn't change anything.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way.

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Rinse and repeat. You will become a hate filled disgusting excuse for a human being, because people have wronged you. So eventually these same people who hurt you, let you destroy yourself. 


When you are stuck in that cycle man, its very difficult too get out. 


The most healthy thing you can do is take this as a lesson for yourself and let them be them, because you can fantasise all you want, nothing is gonna happen too them because you fantasied about it.

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

It may feel good in the moment, anger is a very strong drug, but trust me, it can take you too a place you dont wanna go, because deep down you are crushing your own soul and you get filled with regret and disgust on what you have become and guess what, you will blame them for it too. Rinse and repeat. You will become a hate filled disgusting excuse for a human being, because people have wronged you. So eventually these same people who hurt you, let you destroy yourself. 


When you are stuck in that cycle man, its very difficult too get out. 


The most healthy thing you can do is take this as a lesson for yourself and let them be them, because you can fantasise all you want, nothing is gonna happen too them because you fantasied about it. If you keep doing this, they will keep control over you and thats all on you in the end, no one else.

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me .

1g8ddpc,lsyw7kt,t3_1g8ddpc,Interesting_Pin_3490,"What your therapist has done is painful, but I think he came to the realisation that he couldn't help you anymore. At least in that session.
As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

I can too listen to the same music artist for weeks or even months in a row.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

Never did the crazy pills ( no disrespect to you ) or psycho doctor. ( No disrespect to you ) The thought of thinking a person that doesn't know me , no emotional tie to me , wants me to break down to my lowest self in front of them and pay them to do it, a person really not listening or understanding but looking for key words or statements to match up for their  reaction to me from her little books they've memorized and truly doesn't care after my time runs out on their clock just always sounded stupid , pointless and a complete waste of time to me . 

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me .

What got my stupid ass out of bed was id laid in bed for so long my back started killing me so I had to get up . I came to the conclusion that laying in bed or not , nothing changes , only thing that changed was my back was now feeling like my spine is ripping out my flesh 🤷🏼‍♂️ but everything else was still the same . Being in that bed didn't change anything. 

And eventually you're going to have to get up anyways by choice or by force like my back .

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

1g8jjrn,lsz1q6s,t3_1g8jjrn,DocumentExternal6240,"Gratefulness does help, but not necessarily towards material things. But the problem is that tou have to walk the way out of depression by yourself. Medication and therapy support, butvtou do the works. That is very hard, believe me, but still worth it. Sometimes I also thought that it was bs but went along with it anyway. And in the end, it helped. 

You have to try out what will help you. But it still involves getting out of your comfort zone and following suggestions from your therapist even though they seem dumb to you. I know rhis sucks but if you have a good therapist, he/she can really help you get better if you let them.",3,2024-10-21 07:38:05

Only if you’re depressed but still functioning do people have sympathy for you. I really feel for your situation, and I’m sorry your friends are no support to you.

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad.

As a therapist, his job is to help you, mostly by working through traumas and finding ways to look at yourself and your life from a different perspective. In essence, by learning to be less guilty, judgemental, and sad, and seeing more joy in life, by learning to love yourself more.
On the contrary, you at the moment are dead set to do the opposite. You stick to what you already believe to an obsessive level, and you would find any kind of reason why you can't love yourself.
The trouble is, the 100% foolproof reason why you should love yourself, simply doesn't exist. So you will never find that graddiose thing that would flip your life upside down. For things to change, you need to be willing  to let go of this black or white mindset and decide for yourself that any reason you find to do it is good enough reason.

I was extremely angry and upset (I didn't express it to her) that I had been kicked out, simply because I was not in a good state of mind and it felt like she had done it in a really horrible way. And to be fair, we are used to social relationships where kicking someone out is a very extreme reaction. 

But the therapeutic relationship is not social, and there are times it is appropriate to ask a client to leave. On the one hand, the therapist can't really allow the space to be a place where the client just continuously berates themself, and the therapist does have a duty to suggest other resources/end the therapeutic relationship if they feel they cannot help this client. That doesn't mean the client is unable to be helped, just that this therapist has realised they aren't the best fit. 

Having said that, if OPs therapist said ""Get out"", word for word as OP has recounted, then the therapist did not handle the situation well. Although from my own experience, in a poor mindset it is very possible to misinterpret this sort of interaction.",2,2024-10-21 02:31:14

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me . Perfect perfect perfect setting for what I was doing . Furthest I had to go was to my mailbox , like literally. 

What got my stupid ass out of bed was id laid in bed for so long my back started killing me so I had to get up . I came to the conclusion that laying in bed or not , nothing changes , only thing that changed was my back was now feeling like my spine is ripping out my flesh 🤷🏼‍♂️ but everything else was still the same . Being in that bed didn't change anything. 

And eventually you're going to have to get up anyways by choice or by force like my back . My health change yeah , body got weaker muscles got weaker and living ever day battling the bullshit ( depression) you definitely need somewhat of your physical strength because thats a heavy thing to carry around everyday. Now I'm dealing with phycological bullshit, emotional bullshit, spiritual bullshit and physical bullshit lol smh 🤷🏼‍♂️ that's the only thing laying in that bed did",2,2024-10-21 07:17:07

Rinse and repeat. You will become a hate filled disgusting excuse for a human being, because people have wronged you. So eventually these same people who hurt you, let you destroy yourself. 


When you are stuck in that cycle man, its very difficult too get out. 


The most healthy thing you can do is take this as a lesson for yourself and let them be them, because you can fantasise all you want, nothing is gonna happen too them because you fantasied about it. If you keep doing this, they will keep control over you and thats all on you in the end, no one else.

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me .

Like yes, a depressed person will become suicidal that’s literally the illness but they make you feel weird for having symptoms of your illness. There’s so much pressure to be a high functioning depressive and as soon as you start exhibiting the worse, more debilitating symptoms suddenly people don’t have room for that. Only if you’re depressed but still functioning do people have sympathy for you. I really feel for your situation, and I’m sorry your friends are no support to you. I’m also pretty isolated and the only person I really have who hears me out and understands me is my mom, so I get it.

Don’t take advantage of that or see it as forgiveness though. Absolutely think out the wording you choose as well. In no way do you want her to feel as though you’re blaming her for your behavior.

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad. You don’t regret it like you say you do just sounds like you regret the repercussions that’ll follow. Tell her and stop being a coward.

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

( No disrespect to you ) The thought of thinking a person that doesn't know me , no emotional tie to me , wants me to break down to my lowest self in front of them and pay them to do it, a person really not listening or understanding but looking for key words or statements to match up for their  reaction to me from her little books they've memorized and truly doesn't care after my time runs out on their clock just always sounded stupid , pointless and a complete waste of time to me . 

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me . Perfect perfect perfect setting for what I was doing . Furthest I had to go was to my mailbox , like literally. 

What got my stupid ass out of bed was id laid in bed for so long my back started killing me so I had to get up . I came to the conclusion that laying in bed or not , nothing changes , only thing that changed was my back was now feeling like my spine is ripping out my flesh 🤷🏼‍♂️ but everything else was still the same . Being in that bed didn't change anything. 

And eventually you're going to have to get up anyways by choice or by force like my back . My health change yeah , body got weaker muscles got weaker and living ever day battling the bullshit ( depression) you definitely need somewhat of your physical strength because thats a heavy thing to carry around everyday. Now I'm dealing with phycological bullshit, emotional bullshit, spiritual bullshit and physical bullshit lol smh 🤷🏼‍♂️ that's the only thing laying in that bed did",2,2024-10-21 07:17:07

Leave the ball in her court and give her time and space to think. More likely than not- she’ll feel more betrayed by her stepmom and maybe even come to you for comfort. Don’t take advantage of that or see it as forgiveness though. Absolutely think out the wording you choose as well. In no way do you want her to feel as though you’re blaming her for your behavior.

You wake up and choose to love someone even through hard times. All the reasons you’ve already listed in here are extremely selfish “don’t want to hurt my wife’s feelings, don’t want to lose my kids, scared the step mom is going to tell her first…” Understand that you’ve already broken your wife’s heart she just doesn’t know it yet, and based off how you plan on taking action it seems she’ll be the last to know. 

Everything done in the dark will come to light. You choose to betray her with someone else that’s important in her life. If you were so in love with her understand that conscious decision you made wouldn’t have happened. Even how you’re speaking about it “best sex I ever had” how sad. You don’t regret it like you say you do just sounds like you regret the repercussions that’ll follow. Tell her and stop being a coward.

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

If you can't change their mind and you aren't gonna change yours... what's the point? Why are you doing it? Why do you have to keep arguing when it's leading nowhere and just breaking you mentally? Are they breaking mentally too or are they just laughing because they can tell they're getting under your skin? 

It's just posion to you and it's hurting you. 

I definitely get the desire to be heard and defend things you say but sometimes you absolutely have to just drop the phone and go for a walk or watch tv or just anything else.

I know this isn't the advice you want to hear but it's what you gotta do, man. Who's winning when you're suffering mentally from these arguments?  Take care of yourself. Talk to people who bring you peace.",2,2024-10-21 12:32:26

Once we start arguing over something imaginary, there's no end to it. No one wins. It's just a mental loop that keeps us from seeing reality. Something in you seems to know this already. Whenever you get sucked into it, you're just stuck in the loop together with them, because they can't resist it either. Do you see?

Maybe you can't now but you will be able to drop the phone if you give yourself the chance to do it whether it's 5 minutes, 10 minutes..just keep trying. If you feel addicted to social media maybe it's time to talk to a therapist about it. 

I'm not optimistic or anything, I don't believe we're all here for something but I do believe that the only person who can get you out of what you're in, is you. People can help motivate you and give you tools to help you along the way but ultimately.. it's you.

Do not make the mistake in thinking other people know what you feel, they dont care. They just try too help with cliché's. Do not expect more, the fact they are willing too help should be enough. Not the message they send you.


Its my experience its very rare too find someone who understands you. I got 1 friend who understands me, he lived my life. He is rare and I am happy I know him. For all the other people, I try too not get into detail with them about certain aspects of my life, since they have no experience in that and it will only cause me too be frustrated with them and I will start getting angry and feel betrayed, all that kind of unhealthy stuff.

The most healthy thing you can do is take this as a lesson for yourself and let them be them, because you can fantasise all you want, nothing is gonna happen too them because you fantasied about it. If you keep doing this, they will keep control over you and thats all on you in the end, no one else.


Prison is full of people who have lost this battle. 


Sometimes the most hardest thing to do in life is not fight back, but learn from your mistake and move on. ",2,2024-10-21 12:14:30

Anyways I laid in my bed sleeping when I could, staring at the ceiling, looking out a window that the blinds was down on and a light switch wounding why it was even there 🤷🏼‍♂️ it's not like I'm ever going to use it 🤷🏼‍♂️ I had no job , I was making plenty another way , if I needed something I'd just have the next person coming over to bring it to me .

Being in that bed didn't change anything.

Even when you're striving for something. My desires become empty when I try and siphon every last bit of joy from it. You would think that's a positive. 

The opposite. It's desperation and the acts themselves become nothing but cannon fodder. White noise.

I don't want to let it go... Even if I have too. It's like this  attachment. 

It's a weird balance. Because if the addiction or even positive activity gives you something. It could put you in the headspace for another path

Anything with the intention of living and not just surviving can be a positive. Enjoying and not just tolerating
