1gaxwuw,ltheh08,t3_1gaxwuw,baifengjiu,You're stil young and your pregnancy hormones aren't being kind to you. You're gonna have your baby then graduate. You're gonna have a good degree and land a job that can sustain you and your baby. The man that got you pregnant doesn't matter. You may need to rely a little bit on him now that the baby is young but you don't need to be with him for life. If he doesn't wanna marry you you can leave him down the road.You'll meet people are kind to you and don't look at you differently bc you had a baby out of marriage the world is full of them don't look at your family. You and your baby will be fine. Better days are coming i promise that to you.,1,2024-10-24 08:49:59

So i'm holding off, but ultimately i'm still gonna do it at some point. Plan is to hang myself from a steal and concrete bridge in a state forest 1 mile away. It's half a mile in, i can drive to the parking lot in my car.

I know this is funny, but i'm actually a little afraid of the woods after dark lol. But...yeah. I stress tested in in August. August 20th i think. And...I'm a little heavy so I've wearing a ski mask to cover my neck, so the rope doesn't dig into my neck as much. I don't want it to be gruesome.

I'm slightly worried about escaping and ending up extremely injured. My plan was to handcuff myself behind my back, but i think that's unneccisary. I came up with a middle ground: handcuff my right arm to my jeans/belt (both). That way my weaker arm is free to lower myself down, so no rough landing, but i still probably won't have the strength to lift myself out, with one arm.",2,2024-10-24 05:31:48

I still have friends but who are now more like casual acquaintances. Somewhere I changed because I never used to have this aversion to being around people, in places in public. But for me I can tell you it still makes a difference when those few people I know reach out to me.  And every now and again when I get an offer to do something fun and can force myself to do it I'm always better for having done it. But without those friends checking on me I wouldn't have those moments of joy or at least hope.  One suggestion that definitely works with me is when my friends need me or they seem in pain, helping them is usually something I am very happy to do. Not suggesting unloading drama on your friend, But maybe ask him or her for help with something for you. A gentle reminder that they matter and make a difference in your life.  If you read the posts on here a lot of people feel like they are worthless and toxic, and that withdrawing themselves is somehow the best thing to do for their friends. That's usually wrong.  But even though i am mired in issues,  It still makes me feel something good to feel like i have genuinely been there for someone else.  
 I would also suggest a little experimentation.  I'm not sure if you're gaming at your house or theirs. They might prefer one over the other.  Some people love gaming online over in person.  I don't know their meds but i know sometimes you get to a point where you just don't want to take them. That can pass too. You seem like you genuinely care and are trying.  Just remember there's no easy answer.  But being there for them matters.  We all have to learn be okay with our own selves.

This sounds like an environment that doesn’t allow for a proper childhood. You don’t deserve to die man, your circumstances do.",1,2024-10-24 03:39:05
1gas9ih,ltgk6yn,t1_ltgi4zo,Holiday-City-8874,Thank you. I don’t know why I struggle with financial responsibility but I guess it has to do with never having the things I wanted and now that I have THAT kind of money I can splurge with no regard for myself or others even though I am spending it on things I enjoy like gaming and playing viola which my family also sees as wastes of money. I do have to take care of my disabled sister and that’s usually with my sister who I dash with but she expects me to go to school 8 hours a day dash for 5 and when I express I can’t take care of the disabled sister because I’m exhausted she gets mad and hits me. I honestly don’t think my situation will ever get better.,1,2024-10-24 03:54:17

Video games are awesome, and I’m in no place to judge from a place where I have easy access to them. Ironically, I’m in the opposite situation you are in, after living so easily for so long, I refuse to spend a penny of my money. I just don’t need or deserve any more privileges. The violin is a beautiful thing, is that what you’re passionate about? What video games are your favorite? Mine is Zelda. I hope you enjoy your video games because you deserve the time off. You work about as much as my dad does between your school and home responsibilities, and I never judge my dad for chilling on the phone when he gets home.

1gas9ih,ltgn5ix,t1_ltgkt5p,Holiday-City-8874,Yes I am very passionate about the viola and have been playing since 5th grade but my family has never came to any of my major performances. My favorite game is Apex Legends and The Splatoon series. I’ve found that Video games are my only escape from this harsh reality even if I compromise other things such as eating and sleeping. I have people I hang with that I know talk about me behind my back. I done that since 7th and just can’t seem to leave them even if they do what they do.,1,2024-10-24 04:17:18

If he would have called me I would have helped him realize that pregnancy hormones make people extra crazy and she just needed space to deal with all these new things.

You have so much time, you are nothing but sitting potential. Think of it this way- the time will pass anyway. You could spend these next few years doing nothing, or working towards a place where you're happy and feel accomplished.

A toxic social group (could be a family or a workplace or some other group) usually requires a scapegoat in order to maintain its equilibrium.  Usually the person who gets singled out to be scapegoated is the one who represents the biggest threat to the system.  

Of course that doesn't get any of them off the hook.  They're still all individually making the choice to be assholes, and the fact that there's subtle pressure from the group to maintain the status quo doesn't change that.

So what I did was, I found a degree which would allow me to graduate without having to take any math classes. I got a bachelors degree in disability and human development from UIC and I was able to take all the required courses online. Prior to that I had gotten my associates degree from Harold Washington College which is a reasonably priced college. Anyway, Maybe I got lucky because the pandemic had just started when I transferred to UIC but I stuck it out and I have a mental health issue that I was not born with which also causes me to be depressed. Maybe you can find an easier degree to pursue? Trade school? College isn’t for everyone. You can still become successful without college. What is something you’re passionate about? Maybe you can pursue that. When I was younger and I got fired from Victoria secret and the manager told me I should focus on my music career. I’m not rich but I did cut an original cd 💿.

has the withdraw deadline passed at the school you attend? i would really recommend at least considering dropping out- i understand why you would feel like you’re a “loser”, but you won’t be able to do your best and accomplish your goals if you’re burnt out. i have to tell myself that every day. 

i too felt discouraged, because i love to learn, but i can’t pursue what i’m truly passionate about and can’t focus on the areas that i want to delve into. a lot of people go to college as soon as possible because they feel that’s what they’re “supposed to do”. but it’s much more wise to take your time and ensure you’re at a place where you can reach your full potential. you sound like a self aware person, so i believe that you could do that with time. i get you feel stuck, but there are other options, i promise. there’s no rush. ❤️",3,2024-10-24 01:34:40

Too much stuff to memorize and care about just to forget it all eventually anyway. 
I can say it again that i like my major, but any motivation i had for it got killed years ago. I don’t know how people can put themselves through college without ending up hating their major. Literally one week into a new class/project/semester is already enough for me to be like “I really wanna do something else now”. I don’t know what the word is but i’m multi interested in many things for short moments in time and quickly lose interest. The longer something drags on (college takes years) the more i hate it and the more i’m desperate to be done with it. Whenever i’m done with anything in life i’m celebrating the fact that i never have to do it again. There seems to be something seriously wrong with my brain and i don’t think meds or therapy will fix it. I’m thinking these days that I simply want to be done with life itself

I’m glad i made it this far with college and am almost done with it. I certainly can’t drop out now without being an absolute failure of the family.

However you feel now is completely valid and you should find what makes you happy, if going into school makes you feel empty and depressed then try and find a solution with either your parents/a teacher you like/a friend you go to school with. You’ll find a way around this even if you end up missing this school year.
You can take your exams at your own time if you tell your school how you are feeling. (If you’re in the UK)
Time is on your side, you can retake exams, you can do a gap year after school. Anything you do in your life you have to do what makes you happy.

So, this is mostly from Christianity, like hell and all that. In my childhood, even though my parents weren’t very religious, I attended Sunday school for about nine years by my own choice. I was terrified of hell, Satan, and the dark. Maybe that was just my teachers’ fault. 

Then I found out my dad is Jewish and started exploring Judaism, which changed my perception of things. There’s no hell or powerful Satan as in Christianity. Suicide is still prohibited, but Judaism recognizes mental illness as a factor, and many rabbis believe it changes how suicide is viewed in cases of severe mental states.

I’m not religious now, as I said, but I believe God forgives, if he exists. And if even evil people can expect it, so can we, just ordinary people who’ve struggled.

1. Your entire generation is kinda socially stunted from covid to a certain extent. Some people got lucky and had siblings our their parents didn’t care about covid and socialized them anyway

2. Just to start with an easy fix. There are YouTube videos on social skills you can watch. Social skills are a skill, being able to talk to other people is a skill. It’s something you get better at as you practice it. It is something you can work on.

3. The most important part of this entire thing is it seems like you are highly traumatized from your families consistent issues. There isn’t any real advice to give on this one except needing to find a mental health professional to work through some of these issues with (does your high school have one?) if it does you should really take advantage of that.

Just trust me when I tell you, like everything in life, making friends is a skill you can get better at. For me it was social anxiety that kept me from being able to talk to strangers, but over the time that got way better. You really just have to keep believing in yourself. Your struggles are valid and normal. Also when you are a little older, independency and confidence will help A LOT!! There are a lot of ways to get help or find a community, when you are old enough to do things on your own. There is no reason this will have to continue for 40-60 years because you will definitely have a LOT OF time to find the right people.  And most of the time all it takes is to find one good friend.

Don’t die. You are just having a tough time sitting with all those emotions - sadness, anger, disappointment, grief. 
Cry. Even weeks. Then weeks later, before you notice - you would cry less - daily became every other day; then once a week; then once a month; then you suddenly catch yourself ‘wow, I haven’t cried about this person for a while’.

Ride out the wave first, then you can begin to look at just one area of life you need to tackle and words will begin to have meaning again.

I started making light of them. ""Oh yeah, definitely should end it all cause you've done XX, definitely means you're a horrible person, no way"" ""here you go again, let the drama flow"". 
It's not about mocking, rather accepting that's the way I'm thinking at the moment. It's harmless as I recognise I feel silly afterwards, so I am trying to defuse the cycle by adding some sarcasm/irony into it. 
We work in that way, our brain is wired to be dramatic and make a Biggie out of something inconsequential. Sarcasm, joking about it, accepting, help avoiding the sense of guilt and backlash that comes as the thoughts escalate and we have to deal with feeling silly for having them in the first place.

I sold plasma for $100-$200 week, the rate would vary. You can go twice and they give bonuses if you go without missing.

The other thing I did was sell cold water on the highway off ramp, where traffic would back up at a )£.
I made a really nice sign to hold up so cars in the distant could read it. I had a big cooler and a small bag type cooler. 40 bottles is roughly $5. I sold them£ for a dollar. A lot of people gave me more.
I generally sold 40 bottles in an hour or less. The smallest amount I left with is $60 and a lot of times $80-$85.

Life sucks for a lot of us. I think about how good dead must feel. I get tired of trying to keep the beast at bay.

Of course school is a lot different back when I went in the 1960s, but they’re still his intervention strategies, and if some biochemical changes happening within your system, you’ll have to keep aware of it, don’t let the bullies ruin your life, study the best you can get the best grade you can join different clubs or groups at school, and try to move out of feeling a victim and being more self-assured and perhaps even aggressive toward the bullies.

I struggle with worrying about appearance too, but I think deep down I believe we and everyone else look just fine. We are our own worst critic in this aspect. Wear anything you like and if anyone has a problem with it, that's their energy wasted.

Died 2 weeks later.

My career has been in shambles. I can't even get it going. I crash out after a year anywhere I go. I have severe mental health problems as well. I was finally doing slightly better after 11 years of therapy and treatments before my dad was diagnosed with cancer.

To lose someone so important to you is always hard, but I can’t imagine how must harder it must have been for it to be so sudden. And during such an important time in your life. 

Getting a career started in the first few years after graduation is usually a shaky time for anybody but of course it’s going to be harder when you’ve lost someone so important.

1ga44mf,ltb5ird,t1_ltb1ksc,lizardkween,"Ugh that sucks, I’m sorry. It’s so hard when you want to just do something you’re passionate about but you have to deal with other peoples bullshit. I believe there’s something out there for you where you can follow your passion but maybe not in a client facing way. It might take time to find what the perfect fit is for you but the beauty industry is growing so much and there’s a lot of ways to follow your passion, even if it’s not what it looked like in your head. Either way I’m sorry you’re dealing with it. 

Honestly a year at one place isn’t bad in today’s work environment. I think moving around is pretty normal and for some people staying in one position for too long will just never work. 

Whatever happens I hope you find something that works better for you because you deserve it.

I’ll hear back from disability by March if next year, and that’s just a long time considering I might have to apply again if I get rejected and wait until 2026 just to see if I got accepted or not.

You can also try to tell your parents what your issue is to try and get their help in dealing with this but idk how they will react. Worst case they take away the means to watch it like phone.

Young love. Well I think we all go trough a period where we are desperate to be in relationship and that is when we are young. I tried it with 13 and got nobody back then. Now I even think it is better that i didn't get the girl because those relationships don't always last. And mine definitely wouldn't. 

About guilt... you can ask for forgiveness from the God and then also in church to a priest. That should remove the guilt I hope. Ofc do your best to stop watching porn. Porn definitely isn't good as it teaches us bad things, makes us develop lust and to mostly only be able to love watching it. Makes us not be able to build good relationships that aren't based on lust and sex.

What I CAN say is it does get different. I know it can seem like your life has been one linear progression of human misery, but think about how many changes you've witnessed within your own lifetime. 

You're 28 years old, so you're probably old enough to remember when the internet only came in a box at your house or the computer lab. Now, you can access the entirety of human knowledge in something you carry in your pocket. You've probably heard songs that changed the way you listen to music or seen films or TV shows that gave you new perspectives on life. There's people and things that could change your life in a meaningful way that haven't even been invented yet. And the thing is, there's all that and more still to come. Not all of it will be good, and a lot of it will be bad, but at least it will all be new to you.

In your arrogance, you have the audacity to get on here and think that every person can just ""enjoy the ride"".

You know how hard it is for someone with a mental illness to hear that and try to take that in? 

You like metaphors yeah?
Try this.

It is akin to an individual having broken arms and legs and then being thrown to the bottom of a staircase next to an athlete who is telling them ""look you just put one foot in front of the other it's easy""

Read the room you ignorant tone deaf simpleton.

It’s a trap that depression plays on us. Just like we don’t know life will get better, we also can’t know if life will get worse/stay bad; even if may feel that way. I’ve had my share of depression/suicidal ideation and attempts, it seemed to go on and on and on.

1g9wqyd,lt9rsap,t1_lt9qspo,CarnivalCore,"This is going to sound harsh, but I'm going to be so genuine right now: it is not your responsibility to make sure your own mother doesn't do something to herself. You are 13 years old. I was in your shoes convincing people probably around your mother's age to not kill themselves and the kind of the scars that come from being put in that kind of position so young do not heal.

But even if you were a full grown adult, ""if you leave me I am going to hurt myself"" is a manipulation tactic used by abusers all the time. And the sad truth is for the sake of your own safety, if someone threatens you with that... the best thing you can do is let them. To leave and get better, and maybe hope someone else will find them before anything too drastic happens, and get them somewhere where they can get helped by actual professionals. Not the children they are supposed to love and protect.

I get it will hurt but genuinely you need to talk to a counselor and hope they respect you and listen. That something can be done. Your mother has shown a lot of emotional abuse tactics in the behavior you've described, and I don't doubt she's probably done a lot more to you before now, and maybe will only escalate the longer you're stuck with her. Getting help will probably be the best for you and your siblings, maybe even your mother as well, in the long run.

I saw in your bio that you’re 14, so I’m going to assume you’re in school. I’m not going to lie to you, school is fucking terrible for neurodivergent people let alone having these thoughts and feels as well. 

But honestly it does get easier, and a lot better when you leave school as school is a shithole. In the world after school people really don’t care if you’re autistic/ neurodivergent (in a nice way), it doesn’t bother them, people won’t hate you or victimise you. They’ll just see you as a human being. 

Also there are millions of neurodivergent people out there which gives you a good chance to make friends with people that understand you.

I quit my first job due to depression (and bad management) and I felt absolutely awful about it. I’ve suffered with depression and suicidal thoughts most of my life so I do somewhat know how you feel. 

If it’s an option, try to get therapy, it can help you cope with your current mental state and can also help you with those things that happened to you in your past. 

Failing that, if your suicidal thoughts become worse, please consider calling the suicide hotline as they really can help. 

It will get better, it could possibly get worse but it will get better eventually, please just try to hang in there, you won’t feel like this forever.",1,2024-10-22 21:33:36
1g9szug,lt8whr6,t1_lt8olke,louisgillings,"Thank you, I have thought about therapy many times but that would be an added secret I’d have to keep and I don’t know if I could conceal that on top of everything else; I am pretty good at hiding my emotion and carrying on but I feel like a failure and humiliated after quitting my job; I am so disappointed in myself I can’t even bare to be around anyone.

I have tried writing some songs about how I feel but still the thought about waking up everyday with nothing to do but be reminded that I literally have nothing now really hurts me.

The easy thing to say would be get another job, which is tough within itself, but even then I fear it would be the same situation over again; ideally I’d like to move far away and somehow start my own life doing things that make me happy, but again I don’t know where to even start in doing that.",1,2024-10-22 22:17:31
1g9szug,lt917jj,t1_lt8whr6,Kermitting_OOF-Side,"I get that therapy would be an added secret but from my understanding of your situation it would be very important for you to do and it really can help. An alternative could be mediation which helped me a lot and allowed me to be able to function as a human being, and it might not be as big as a secret for you to have compared to therapy as it’s just a pill you swallow in the mornings. 

Writing songs as a way to express your emotions can be really effective and I would really try to keep that up. I personally do drawings that I use to direct how I feel and even though some of them can be quite dark, it does help me. 

Honestly if your not in a situation where you really need the money to live, then I wouldn’t get a job until you’ve made progress working through this, I quit my job years ago and still haven’t been able to get a job because of my depression. 

There is also a phone line for Samaritans (might be called something else depending on where you live) it’s not really a suicide hot line but it’s just there so that you can talk to someone about your problems and you wouldn’t have to commit to doing weekly therapy sessions if that’s something you can’t do. Additionally, there are phone lines that help with sexual abuse, I’ve thankfully never been in the situation where I’ve had to use them however I had a friend that called them because she was abused and they really helped her and they are specially trained in that area. 

I am open to talk if you need or want to.",1,2024-10-22 22:44:51

We can’t control what happens to us, only how we react to it. You’re still very young and not sure about your identity. Neither are your friends. What I mean by that is you haven’t found what you truly enjoy in life. The only way to find it is to go out and experience different things. There are people out there affected by similar if not some of the same things you are and have cracked the code on how to enjoy life. You’ll want to connect with people that live with autism, ADHD or both. They are on LinkedIn. These are people with regular jobs, nothing fancy. Sometimes they have people that join webinars/zoom calls where people connect to talk about their struggles in their professional and personal lives or 1:1. Invest more into your health. Nourish your body with healthier food and exercise. A lot of the processed foods out there can affect your mental and physical health in the worst of ways. Your 20’s is a huge growth period as an adult and this is where you navigate on your own and find out little and big things that bring happiness into your life. These are not things that society say should make you happy at your age, but things that you experience and enjoy only for your own happiness… not the happiness of your family, not the happiness of your friends, not the happiness of coworkers, just you. The hardest part will be freeing your mind from these heavy chains you’ve put on it. When you feel the energy to do so, look into some activities you haven’t done before and go on some ‘self-dates’. As an example, my guilty pleasure lately has been going to my local animal shelter and taking a dog out for a few hours in the day so they can have a little freedom. I did not think something so minor would make me one of the happiest beings but it does. The happy energy from those dogs feed me, literally. You’d need to find activities that mesh with having autism and ADHD of course. Hoping you pivot to a more positive place and very soon.",1,2024-10-23 01:27:01

He ended up saving my life by calling EMS saying his good friend was committing suicide and therefore, he essentially SAVED MY LIFE!! 💯🙌🙏🏼🙏🏼🩷🩷

I have custody of our 2 children. I had to sell our house, spent close to 500k on legal fees. Pretty much broke. I took time off of work - short term disability so that I could spend more time with my children. I was working crazy hours, wasn’t sleeping at night, had to patience. Felt like I was going to have a nervous breakdown. When I was supposed to go back to work I was told they didn’t want me back. But that feeling was mutual. I couldn’t go back to working for a company that was asking me to pretty much abandon my children. So now I need to find a new job. I’ve been dating someone for a while now and things went to shit yesterday. My fault completely. I’m a bit broken. I drank an entire bottle of tequila last night. Threw in some Xanax for the fun of it. Just wanted to fall asleep and not feel for a while. Do I want to die? Sometimes. But I have to keep up the good fight.

1. Call child protective services or the police and tell them about the abuse. They may be able to remove you from your home
2. Talk to a friend or relative to see if you could move in with them
3. Speak with a teacher or school counselor and talk about the abuse.
4. Tell your school counselor, teacher, or emergency services that you are suicidal and have a plan. Depending on the country, they’re required to move you to a mental hospital to prevent you from hurting yourself

1g9o5hy,lt8uiae,t3_1g9o5hy,Prodigal_Son111,"It was never irrational to begin with. The ""irrationality"" argument just comes from a strong bias towards living, because we evolved for it, not because ""it's actually the only valid and objective position"". So ironically this is an emotional and biased argument too.

The only reason we see the expression of a desire to die be demonized and the desire to live be praised is because of people's evolutionary wiring. An evolved chimp will (almost) never admit life's not worth living. We've literally evolved psychological mechanisms to outright deny factual evidence to keep our perspective and desire to live. You can see this in Christians denying Evolution for example.

So....humans were never meant to be rational creatures. We have intelligence only insofar as it's useful for survival, for technological development for example. But humans will continue to mindlessly romanticize life at any cost. In reality, there's no such thing as the ""correct"" way to think or act. There is no objective standard, of behavior, morality, value, truth, meaning, purpose....it's all subjective and a biologically imposed way of thinking. There is no ""wrong"" response to life. The facts about life are objective, and our response to them is completely up to us. Acting like a psychopath, acting like a saint....dying, not dying....neither one of these is more valid than the others.",5,2024-10-22 22:06:11

There are infinite variables, possibilities, actions, inaction, domino effects as result of all of those things. It is illogical to believe that some people don’t actually enjoy life. “One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure.” Now does that help us feel better? No but it’s a logical inconsistency in your list. It’s more emotion based. As for feeling happier the only advice I have is do your bucket list. I’ve been doing mine and you never know what or when you feel a new emotion, what can make you feel alive. Everything has a domino effect.

I think in my case, it was the pressure and anxiety being lifted. I had (am still working through it but it hasn't gone away) really bad anxiety and I guess the idea of nothing mattering in a couple years made life a little more bareable. Not having to worry about my relationships with others, trying to get everyone to like me, trying to make everyone happy at the cost of my own happiness, is a really damn good feeling. And I don't think I ever pieced that together in my younger years, I thought it was just that I wanted to get to the end asap. 

So, TLDR, for me it was a lack of anxiety and pressure that gave me this sense of freedom and lifted spirit. I think, Idk I mean you never really know anything ig but I'm pretty sure.",52,2024-10-22 21:31:56

Everything felt even worse for the next few days, but I got through it.

I hope you’re still around in the future. Just know it’s normal to have especially bad days, and it isn’t the end of your life. This too shall pass. Jobs, clothes, bikes…it can all be replaced. And clean streaks can be restarted.

I’ve experienced this same feeling at times, and it is a weird paradox. It’s either been that everything has piled up so much in my life that suddenly my mind snaps and I can accept the bad without feeling I have to control it, or that I can accept it all because I’ve taken back control by planning my end. 

Perhaps through therapy or counselling you may discover a way to experience this liberating feeling from another means. I’m not saying it’ll be easy. For me the passive suicidal side is still there, but there are things I can do to feel that sense of control or acceptance of my situation without the suicide plan.

1g9n4sx,lt8uuz2,t1_lt8qyn8,Former-Increase4190,"I graduated college, but I hated the idea of going for a Master's. My sister got married, and I was living with her so I had to move back in with my parents. I had obviously not been good for awhile, but it got so much worse. But the thing that stopped me was a particularly bad episode where I got angry and resentful at everyone who loved me, every tie I had to this earth that kept me here. So I opened up to my mother about it. 

I had been to two therapists before, and thought it was all a bunch of bs. Their stupid, flowery language and bullshit reassurances. But this time, it was different. She was blunt, said what she meant, and told me when she was sugarcoating things. Got diagnosed with MDD and GAD, along with what she thinks is undiagnosed ADHD. I fucking hated the idea of meds, I hated having to stay alive for everyone else, and after the first two doses didn't work I was starting to slip again. 

But the third dosage def shifted things. I still had all the same thoughts, but without that overbearing haze of hopelessness. Started getting more enthusiastic in therapy, opening up more and learning more about myself.

Turns out I had no sense of identity because the idea of having wants and needs were emotionally drained out of me at a very young age. I still have trouble with what I want, and even more trouble expressing it.

But this is the best I have ever been, for as long as I can remember. It's never left my mind as an option, I'll be real, but it's... not the only option anymore. Found websites that could hook you up with jobs around the states, and it's been huge. Getting away from the cycles of unaware emotional abuse that my family unwillingly follows was, I think, the biggest turning point for me. And I never realized all of the things that were abuse and neglect.

Sorry if it's long-winded, but I feel like everything was necessary to explain what made me stop going to suicide as a last resort. Best advice I have: don't quit on therapy bc of a few bad therapists. And think about why you were curious about what changed my mind 😗

I don’t want to invalidate you by saying that that’s the experience often of being  in your early 20s and being smacked in the face by the reality of the economy and the fear of not knowing what you’ll do to afford everything that comes with it, but I truly do think it’s part of the process. A lot of us who don’t have a lot of familial support are faced with this terrifying hulking beast ahead that is our financial situation. For a lot of people it takes a long time and often a lot of mistaken passion or changing your mind to finally find your career. You don’t know what will happen or what you’ll stumble upon or make happen in the next decade, which, by the way, is the decade that it usually takes scraping through and suffering through in the form of learning to achieve comfort as an adult in their 30s. 

My mom moved out of her parents’ home when she was 19, and out of fear of obligations and not feeling like she was good enough to find a solid career, she dropped out of college, got married to an abusive asshole, and had 3 kids she didn’t really even want (hello there!) I cannot even begin to explain to you how much bullshit she had to experience to get to where she is today, with my stepdad who would find some way to bring her the sun if she asked, always traveling, laughing, eating something yummy, finally found her place in the world. she’s not rich at all but she isn’t plagued with this insane fear of knowing she has her entire future in her hands and one wrong move will put her in a bad position. She ended up being a pretty successful realtor, in case you were curious, but that’s not really the point.

This is just an insane amount of pressure to live with, so please pat yourself on the back for carrying it and staying for your sweet puppy even though you feel so scared and alone. I can’t promise you that you’ll end up some fancy businessperson but I just want you to stay and see what happens. The friends you might make, the hurdles you might be able to get over to maybe attend college (do you live in the US? are you sure you don’t qualify for any form of financial aid? getting zero interest student loans, need-based grants, and need-based scholarships is not as hard to do as it might seem, and if you live here, I might be able to help show you). the jobs you’ll have on the way that you never even saw coming, along with opportunities from meeting new people that you can’t promise won’t come, because you just don’t know. so like the other person said, it’s time to breathe, because your words are powerful and saying that there is nothing left for you is making the pain worse. even if you believe it, and I’m not taking that away from you. now is the time to cuddle your pup, drink cold water, wash your face if you’ve been crying, and reach out to someone, anyone, even me. You’ve gotta talk yourself down because yeah it is very important that you stay, even if you’re not sure why yet. Staying is ALWAYS better. I hope you’ll update us on how you’re feelin tomorrow. 💜❤️ hugs",1,2024-10-22 19:47:07

They might not even send you straight to a behavioral unit. They might send you to a medical wing first, especially since you’ve gone through all those antihistamines. Do I think inpatient is perfect? Hell no. Do I think it COULD help you? Absolutely.",1,2024-10-22 16:40:35
1g9mgjq,lt7bn9p,t3_1g9mgjq,kfmush,"What antihistamine? I’m assuming Diphenhydramine? And how long has it been since you last took any?

Diphenhydramine can be quite neurotoxic in large, repeated doses. And it is very possible there may be lasting effects from that much in such a short time. However, it’s not the worst I’ve heard of and the lasting effects shouldn’t be as severe as what you’re experiencing now, assuming it’s been less than a couple days since you last took any antihistamines. 

I would seek inpatient care, as long as it’s not some very judgmental small town (then I’d just try to stay hydrated and rested for a couple of days and not touch anymore drugs). They can monitor your health and possibly give you something to halt the hallucinations, like a benzo such as Valium.

You may feel cognitively “fuzzy” and slow-minded in an unpleasant way for a few days after you stop taking the DPH (if that’s what you were taking).",1,2024-10-22 17:23:06

It's been 24 hours since I took any and honestly the only two reasons I haven't taken any more is because I have none left and even if I did, I still taste the pills and have been in and out of sleep for awhile and it is horrible. Definitely am considering inpatient, but college is pretty unforgiving of absences, so. Still considering, just weighing my possible options.

It made me suffer for a long time, but now I feel much easier about it. The fact is that beauty, like many other things, is fickle and changeable. Now beautiful people are young, so they do it, but everyone will grow old and lose their beauty someday. This is not the kind of thing that will be with them forever. And even if we don't talk about aging, everyone can get into an accident or something similar, getting scars that ""disfigure"" them. Understanding all this is liberating. There is no point in clinging and suffering for beauty if we all have the same outcome - aging and death. I hope this text will somehow help you stop suffering. ",1,2024-10-22 17:04:36

Found a thing of Honey Chai Turmeric tea, and came to the realization that I'm an American that doesn't drink tea...  
I truly have no clue the proper way to make tea or anything...

So I'm sorry for butchering it by microwaving the water in a coffee mug and then steeping it and adding a little milk for taste...

‘Teetotal tea toast (microwave ambiance) for a splendiferous festivity’ - does that sound pretentious enough? 

And I think your coffee mug has now become the designated tea receptacle btw.

The turmeric was definitely carrying a heavy weight there, that must be admitted into fact.  
It was quite overpowering.

If you od on that you’re going to be in the worst pain of your life for multiple hours, you’ll have no control over your body and have a seizure while being fully conscious, your family is going to come in and find you, and then depending on where you live you’re going to be stuck in a hospital living like a controlled zombie for an indefinite period of time.

And the kicker? Even if you’re not found, you’re likely going to be bedridden sick and wish you were found because you’re not going to have the energy to do a thing. You’ll be covered in vomit and shit too. That’s typically the point where people “wake up” and realize they did something dumb, and then they go on to live with medical conditions for the rest of their life. I know you may think you’re special and you think you wouldn’t possibly do that, that you’d just try again in some other way as soon as possible, but that’s what everyone thinks, and, well, studies and psychology shows that 9 out of 10 people who make a serious attempt at suicide and fail either won’t try it again, or they won’t be successful if they do.

1g9i9mz,lt9mfoc,t3_1g9i9mz,dontmindmejustarando,"No. Those cases were likely people with other circumstances that contributed. Especially at 17, the body is very resilient. You'll either throw it all up or shit it out. Violently. But it won't kill you.

At 17 I'd really recommend telling your parents. In any way you can. I know, I know. It's really fucking stupid advice when you hear it. I thought it was too. Especially when they're the reason you're suicidal, and they were for me. But after my mom found out, she was nice about it. I still didn't ever tell her when I was feeling suicidal, but knowing she really, truly cared helped. And after finding out that *she* was the cause, my mom got better. Not all at once, and not perfect, but she stopped being abusive. So tell them. Worst case scenario you don't get help and you're in the same place you were.

Also high school fucking sucks. Like that's just a fact of life it is always the worst time of your entire life. Once you hit college it's all up from there. 

(Option two, for if it puts you in physical danger to tell your parents: Tell a friend, and ask them to make you get help if they think you need it. Tell them to do whatever they think is necessary. My friend did that to me and it was life changing, for the better. We didn't end up taking me to the hospital, but I'll never forget hearing them cry because they thought I would leave them.)",3,2024-10-23 00:48:09

Nah, this is a waste of time and money. Get some Ben & Jerry's instead another pack of that shit.

I lost my virginity at 31. Then I met another girl a couple years later. We see each other sometimes but mainly what I'm trying to say is, what you think matters so much, doesn't matter at all. Upon having sex the first time then more times to follow, you'll realize it's not worth living and dying for. Pussy is aight. The girl is waaaay more important, but even then, eventually girls are a headache lol. 

Start slow. Start by talking to girls and meeting people. Each time you put yourself out there, you'll get farther. Asking a girl out on a date and getting rejected is the best thing you can do for yourself. It's more valuable than getting accepted. Talk to people at work and school. Make a dying profile and talk. To people and meet people. Get used to it. Learn to like the connection. It's not about sex. It's about the person you're talking to. Girls love that but don't love guys that aggressively chase tail.

Learn to sit comfortably in a room with people and feel like you belong there. Remember, we are primates in a society and You are one of them, and you belong in this society with your fellow monkeys. You're one of us and we're all the same as you. Meet people and make friends.

Sex comes easier when you SEE people. It's a connection thing more than a sex thing. Girls want to have sex with someone they feel comfortable with, so meet people and get to know them. You'll find the connection is even more rewarding than the sex.",0,2024-10-22 13:18:48

You can meet them randomly just by going out in the community and interacting. In your 20s, taking community college courses puts you on campus where a significant portion of people will be women also in their 20s or a few years off younger or older. Depending on your area, there may be other community events like concerts, festivals, farmers markets, and other classes put on by private businesses like fitness, arts, &c. You can volunteer at an animal shelter, homeless shelter, library, fire department or various other places or with organizations such as disaster relief preparedness (FEMA, OES)

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Seek support from family, friends, and authorities if necessary, but there is no reason to end your life during any period of your life when you're in school.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs.

The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Part of spending time trying to help others through their worst periods is learning how to accept and deal with moments like this, not in a dismissive way but rather in a way that reccognizes that others are in the same need and we may be able to help them; we grow by experience and by learning from others, and a large part of learning is confronting failure. Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

I'm not there yet but I hope to be one day.

1g8z4f2,lt49afz,t1_lt48kpv,The_mad_Inari,I know it must hurt and you don't sound stupid or toxic sometimes we can lose ourselves and hurt others in the process. But the best thing you can do is focus on your self because being hung up on him will only hurt you more in the long run it may take years for you to stop hating yourself for it but eventually it will get better. It took me two years to finally come to terms with it then he  came back into my life and I was like bruh I just got over you ya lil shit but honestly if that does happen then best thing you can do is just try to figure yourself out and change for the better because you want to not because you want to be what someone else wants.,1,2024-10-22 03:20:38

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

It honestly really helped, it helped me see things from others perspectives and I often beat myself up a lot for what happened as I'm not a horrible person and not abusive but my depression makes me horrible which when I've managed to calm down I feel so bad for how I treated people I care about.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Part of spending time trying to help others through their worst periods is learning how to accept and deal with moments like this, not in a dismissive way but rather in a way that reccognizes that others are in the same need and we may be able to help them; we grow by experience and by learning from others, and a large part of learning is confronting failure. Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Seek support from family, friends, and authorities if necessary, but there is no reason to end your life during any period of your life when you're in school.

As for the social stuff, that's just a time issue. You're in middle school, so you probably have around five more years until you're a legal adult. I can say that the social issues get much better in high school. I can only suggest you do what you can to make it easier in that aspect. Skip school if you want, who gives a shit.

Easier said than done I know! But these people are often so miserable they'll take it out on other people to make themselves feel better.

It took me two years to finally come to terms with it then he  came back into my life and I was like bruh I just got over you ya lil shit but honestly if that does happen then best thing you can do is just try to figure yourself out and change for the better because you want to not because you want to be what someone else wants.,1,2024-10-22 03:20:38

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

As for college, it's not for everyone. Unless you want to be an engineer, lawyer, or medical personnel, there's no point in going anyway. The trades make a shitton of money now. The richest guy I've ever met is a plumber.

As for the social stuff, that's just a time issue. You're in middle school, so you probably have around five more years until you're a legal adult. I can say that the social issues get much better in high school. I can only suggest you do what you can to make it easier in that aspect. Skip school if you want, who gives a shit.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Seek support from family, friends, and authorities if necessary, but there is no reason to end your life during any period of your life when you're in school.

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

It may seem horrible and slow now, as middle school can literally be one quarter of your life at this point, but it will end, and it will end sooner than you think. Seek support from family, friends, and authorities if necessary, but there is no reason to end your life during any period of your life when you're in school.

For perspective, most adults barely remember middle school, and there is so much afterward to look forward to. Seek to improve your situation to the max extent possible before you let it get to you. Good luck.",-1,2024-10-21 16:56:02

As for the social stuff, that's just a time issue. You're in middle school, so you probably have around five more years until you're a legal adult. I can say that the social issues get much better in high school. I can only suggest you do what you can to make it easier in that aspect. Skip school if you want, who gives a shit.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

It took me two years to finally come to terms with it then he  came back into my life and I was like bruh I just got over you ya lil shit but honestly if that does happen then best thing you can do is just try to figure yourself out and change for the better because you want to not because you want to be what someone else wants.,1,2024-10-22 03:20:38

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Part of spending time trying to help others through their worst periods is learning how to accept and deal with moments like this, not in a dismissive way but rather in a way that reccognizes that others are in the same need and we may be able to help them; we grow by experience and by learning from others, and a large part of learning is confronting failure. Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

A person who is gravely ill, or considering to the end its life, cannot simply “help itself.” It is like telling someone in the final stages of cancer, “Hey, cure yourself.” Furthermore, writing to a stranger without knowing anything about it—not even its name—and without any means of ongoing contact, does not truly offer support or prevent anything from happening. I do not mean to be harsh, and I sincerely appreciate the fact that you made an effort, but this is not helpful.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

You aren’t ungrateful by virtue of mentioning that. You are simply expressing that something is still missing. Please don’t leave right now. Your pain is bottling up inside and only make the situation worse. Often times people say find an outlet, but that sounds passive. You do very unique drawings, and not many people can create characters like you do. Instead of using drawing as a passive outlet, perhaps be active and throw your darkest feelings and thoughts onto that paper as hard as you can. You have talent, and through hardship comes greatness. Look at the life of Frida Kahlo, painful but so vivacious, and what’s more is her pain went into canvas that we can all observe and relate to. Please don’t leave us, let the drawings speak for you, and open up. You aren’t pathetic, you are human with unique, deep struggle but that is an opportunity for greatness. I and definitely more than “one or two” people are here for you. Don’t leave. Seek help first, cry out through your artwork if you can’t find the words to communicate your pain.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

It honestly really helped, it helped me see things from others perspectives and I often beat myself up a lot for what happened as I'm not a horrible person and not abusive but my depression makes me horrible which when I've managed to calm down I feel so bad for how I treated people I care about.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Part of spending time trying to help others through their worst periods is learning how to accept and deal with moments like this, not in a dismissive way but rather in a way that reccognizes that others are in the same need and we may be able to help them; we grow by experience and by learning from others, and a large part of learning is confronting failure. Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

I never achieved anything in my life and on top of that i have asperger's which means i suck even at things the average Joe can do with ease. and now i just want to either die or sit in a comfort zone and waste all my useless life away until i die.",2,2024-10-22 12:26:54

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

It's a deeper romance, for two lovers to kiss over their ills, then their roses. Why? For a couple to risk the reproduction of their absurdities, affirms life despite its faults. Not only when obviously good, but when despicably bad. Two people whom meet, and play with each other recklessly, must be smitten by a great force, to steal their concerns.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

And I'm really sorry that an image of you was shared like that, even if it isn't overtly sexual, it's gross having grown men rate 15 year old girls. 

It's really fucking hard but really worth the journey: having your sense of self-worth come from within. Not from others, and definitely not from random creeps online who have nothing better to do than troll and be gross.

Easier said than done I know! But these people are often so miserable they'll take it out on other people to make themselves feel better. 

All the happiest people I know aren't necessarily the most beautiful or ""successful"" (meaning rich to most people). They are simply comfortable in their own skin and have made a life that works for them.

I'm not there yet but I hope to be one day.

What you can do, is make sure it never happens again. You can show yourself that you are worthy of redemption. There will be other loves in your life, if you can love yourself enough to accept it.

1g8z4f2,lt49afz,t1_lt48kpv,The_mad_Inari,I know it must hurt and you don't sound stupid or toxic sometimes we can lose ourselves and hurt others in the process. But the best thing you can do is focus on your self because being hung up on him will only hurt you more in the long run it may take years for you to stop hating yourself for it but eventually it will get better. It took me two years to finally come to terms with it then he  came back into my life and I was like bruh I just got over you ya lil shit but honestly if that does happen then best thing you can do is just try to figure yourself out and change for the better because you want to not because you want to be what someone else wants.,1,2024-10-22 03:20:38

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Part of spending time trying to help others through their worst periods is learning how to accept and deal with moments like this, not in a dismissive way but rather in a way that reccognizes that others are in the same need and we may be able to help them; we grow by experience and by learning from others, and a large part of learning is confronting failure. Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

Instead seek for natural solutions to overcome your demons. The best feeling in the world is to feel happiness, this is a free natural drug gifted to us human beings by nature itself. Immerse yourself in doing activities you find fun to do and you will understand what I mean.",2,2024-10-21 20:57:47

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you.

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

A person who is gravely ill, or considering to the end its life, cannot simply “help itself.” It is like telling someone in the final stages of cancer, “Hey, cure yourself.” Furthermore, writing to a stranger without knowing anything about it—not even its name—and without any means of ongoing contact, does not truly offer support or prevent anything from happening.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

But the best thing you can do is focus on your self because being hung up on him will only hurt you more in the long run it may take years for you to stop hating yourself for it but eventually it will get better. It took me two years to finally come to terms with it then he  came back into my life and I was like bruh I just got over you ya lil shit but honestly if that does happen then best thing you can do is just try to figure yourself out and change for the better because you want to not because you want to be what someone else wants.,1,2024-10-22 03:20:38

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

It honestly really helped, it helped me see things from others perspectives and I often beat myself up a lot for what happened as I'm not a horrible person and not abusive but my depression makes me horrible which when I've managed to calm down I feel so bad for how I treated people I care about.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Part of spending time trying to help others through their worst periods is learning how to accept and deal with moments like this, not in a dismissive way but rather in a way that reccognizes that others are in the same need and we may be able to help them; we grow by experience and by learning from others, and a large part of learning is confronting failure. Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

Sometimes there is no way to help people who come here. I remember staying awake all night to talk with someone who was overdosing on pills just so they wouldn't have to die alone. Things can't always work out well

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15
1g8w8aq,lt1rjz2,t1_lt1qo5l,cakenose,"I also see that you frequent suicidewatch or have come here in the past and I’m begging you to do what’s right for you and try not to come here too often. It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

It took me two years to finally come to terms with it then he  came back into my life and I was like bruh I just got over you ya lil shit but honestly if that does happen then best thing you can do is just try to figure yourself out and change for the better because you want to not because you want to be what someone else wants.,1,2024-10-22 03:20:38

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Sometimes we are not experienced enough to help someone, sometimes someone is dealing with an issue that cannot be helped: this is not your fault, and you did do the best you were able to

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you.

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Even if I had a healthy family, I would still cause them problems because my mental health is not only affected by my shitty family; today my family has another new very big debt, at least for us who are a family that over the years has been surviving with the money they have. You know not having money is such a horrible pain, I want to kill myself. They had a BIG legal problem and it was solved, giving ALLLL the fucking money but it was solved.

I am a failure as an adult, I don't like going to college and I don't even want to work. What's more, I never seriously wanted to be an adult.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

You know not having money is such a horrible pain, I want to kill myself. They had a BIG legal problem and it was solved, giving ALLLL the fucking money but it was solved.

I am a failure as an adult, I don't like going to college and I don't even want to work. What's more, I never seriously wanted to be an adult.

If someone truly needs support, they won’t find it in these words.",11,2024-10-22 03:13:56

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you.

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

I didn’t fight back. I could have, but I didn’t. 

While I would never take her back…I do forgive her. 

You can find forgiveness too.

The long and short is, and I don’t want to make ANY excuses: I got complacent. I took the good times for granted, I settled with how our arguments resolved, which often sounded with me going, “I’ll be better next time.” or, “Im so glad you understand me.” cuz I really DID feel understood.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

Also Im happy for u that u found ur true love 🫂",2,2024-10-22 11:46:32

You know not having money is such a horrible pain, I want to kill myself. They had a BIG legal problem and it was solved, giving ALLLL the fucking money but it was solved.

I am a failure as an adult, I don't like going to college and I don't even want to work. What's more, I never seriously wanted to be an adult. This being one is a big fucking responsibility and I don't want it at all. A few days ago I vented on another subreddit and someone made fun of me, it didn't affect me THAT much because I come from an overly abusive family however I got to thinking and he's right.

I honestly wish with all my fucking heart that I had DIE in one of my several suicide attempts. I can't take this life anymore. I've had enough.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

I lost my virginity at 31. Then I met another girl a couple years later. We see each other sometimes but mainly what I'm trying to say is, what you think matters so much, doesn't matter at all. Upon having sex the first time then more times to follow, you'll realize it's not worth living and dying for. Pussy is aight. The girl is waaaay more important, but even then, eventually girls are a headache lol. 

Start slow. Start by talking to girls and meeting people. Each time you put yourself out there, you'll get farther. Asking a girl out on a date and getting rejected is the best thing you can do for yourself. It's more valuable than getting accepted. Talk to people at work and school. Make a dying profile and talk. To people and meet people. Get used to it. Learn to like the connection. It's not about sex. It's about the person you're talking to. Girls love that but don't love guys that aggressively chase tail.

Learn to sit comfortably in a room with people and feel like you belong there. Remember, we are primates in a society and You are one of them, and you belong in this society with your fellow monkeys. You're one of us and we're all the same as you. Meet people and make friends.

I know people have put themselves down for less, and suffering is relative, but objectively, there are levels to this shit. You'd have to trust a stranger, when I say, the adventure of losing your virginity can be a fun one. You're probably too desperate for the outcome of sex, and not savoring the journey. Losing your virginity with someone special can be a beautiful human journey of self-improvement, and maturity, acceptance, confidence, vulnerability, transformation, or, trauma. So tread carefully. Detach from the outcome, and attach/savor the journey. When it's done, it's done. Oh, and when it's done, throw me a fucking sword. I'm running out.",-7,2024-10-22 01:03:12

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

1g8w8aq,lt1qo5l,t3_1g8w8aq,cakenose,"hey bud, so it’s okay to feel this way over a topic like this. your problem is big to you, and that’s all that matters. I want you to start by understanding that if you feel suicidal over it, nothing else is so much more important. You’ve got to be on your own side and empathize with yourself. You’re young, life is probably hard in a couple of other ways for you, you have depression, no other people to confide in. You’re actually very well spoken in your ability to tell your story and explain why your pain is significant, how much she helped you get by, etc. 

It always hurts the most in the beginning when you have to learn how to get back into a daily routine without someone who was just there with you for everything and made things less painfully quiet. But when that initial sting wears off, it gets easier. You don’t know this yet because this was your first love, and that’s what makes this all so much more painful. You haven’t been alive long enough or experienced enough to learn that this will be a distant memory just a year from now, and in five you’ll most likely be in love again— if not with a person then for sure a new dream, goal, job, hobby, or friend group. There are so many ways to survive beyond that person. Just ask me, or any of the countless people who have been in your shoes. It’ll all be okay, man. And we’re living proof. For now, things are going to suck, but you might not realize how young you really are. This is the tiniest speck of sand in the timeline of your life full of multiple people you’ll get to love in the future. So don’t deny yourself that over just one relationship that unfortunately didn’t work out. You haven’t yet met all the people you’ll get to love and laugh with! but to meet them, for now, you’ll have to keep doing the hard thing and waking up. taking care of yourself and keeping yourself busy, because you’ll spend a lot of time in your life being single before you meet the one. 

I’m a 22 year old girl. I met my first love when I was 15. We only dated for a few months, maybe three— doesn’t matter. I was torn up for a good 10 months before it felt like I could breathe again. I remember feeling so silly and pathetic for missing someone that long. I wondered why it was so painful for me… I felt like someone was standing on my chest 24/7 and I couldn’t eat much or sleep. I’ve dated several people since then, and looking back, I realize it’s just that the first love really, really hurts. But guess what!! I’m living with the true love of my life today. We have a cat together and every day is full of laughs, good meals, and hugs. 

Life goes on if you give it time.",2,2024-10-21 18:43:15

It might not seem like it makes a big difference, but looking at this stuff is so bad for you and will make you feel more hopeless than you need to feel. you’re 16. The world is yours for the taking. and you’re not gonna help yourself thrive or heal by talking to a lot of grown adults who are at the end of their rope and have nothing good to say to you. I don’t mean to factor your age in too much, because depression is a disease that affects people of all ages (and I’ve had it for 10 years) but you happen to be in some really important formative years and it is not. too. late. so just wanted to share that, and I hope you do what’s best for your health man.",3,2024-10-21 18:47:48

I really appreciate ur comment

Everything is just going so downhill these days, literally everything, I never had a good life, or a life I enjoy, I had a few failings about 4 months ago which it's a long story to tell rn (I can tell u tho if ur interested), but that really fucked me up and I'm still recovering from it, and so many other stuff, and this breakup just hit me in the face rn

And she was the only person who really helped me to go through this, but now, when everything is going down again, she left, and now I'm on my own again...

Long story short, life sucks

And I'm not *that* suicidal cause this was just another pain that I should go through, but surely it's a tough one...

I have some responsibilities towards my family so I basically can't kms 

So, yeah

Also it's so hard for me to actually date someone since I don't have much interactions with ppl, and mostly girls, and I'm not a good looking person so basically ppl won't like me at first, and also if this is how it is ig I never date someone again

I lost my virginity at 31. Then I met another girl a couple years later. We see each other sometimes but mainly what I'm trying to say is, what you think matters so much, doesn't matter at all. Upon having sex the first time then more times to follow, you'll realize it's not worth living and dying for. Pussy is aight. The girl is waaaay more important, but even then, eventually girls are a headache lol. 

Start slow. Start by talking to girls and meeting people. Each time you put yourself out there, you'll get farther. Asking a girl out on a date and getting rejected is the best thing you can do for yourself. It's more valuable than getting accepted. Talk to people at work and school. Make a dying profile and talk. To people and meet people. Get used to it. Learn to like the connection. It's not about sex. It's about the person you're talking to. Girls love that but don't love guys that aggressively chase tail.

Learn to sit comfortably in a room with people and feel like you belong there. Remember, we are primates in a society and You are one of them, and you belong in this society with your fellow monkeys. You're one of us and we're all the same as you. Meet people and make friends.

Sex comes easier when you SEE people. It's a connection thing more than a sex thing. Girls want to have sex with someone they feel comfortable with, so meet people and get to know them. You'll find the connection is even more rewarding than the sex.",0,2024-10-22 13:18:48

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence. He would tell me the next day that he worries about me, but because I onlu got drunk once or twice a week I thought, “It’s not THAT bad. I can kick it no problem.”",1,2024-10-22 03:23:52

I lost my virginity at 31. Then I met another girl a couple years later. We see each other sometimes but mainly what I'm trying to say is, what you think matters so much, doesn't matter at all. Upon having sex the first time then more times to follow, you'll realize it's not worth living and dying for. Pussy is aight. The girl is waaaay more important, but even then, eventually girls are a headache lol. 

Start slow. Start by talking to girls and meeting people. Each time you put yourself out there, you'll get farther. Asking a girl out on a date and getting rejected is the best thing you can do for yourself. It's more valuable than getting accepted. Talk to people at work and school. Make a dying profile and talk. To people and meet people. Get used to it. Learn to like the connection. It's not about sex. It's about the person you're talking to. Girls love that but don't love guys that aggressively chase tail.

Learn to sit comfortably in a room with people and feel like you belong there. Remember, we are primates in a society and You are one of them, and you belong in this society with your fellow monkeys. You're one of us and we're all the same as you. Meet people and make friends.

Sex comes easier when you SEE people. It's a connection thing more than a sex thing. Girls want to have sex with someone they feel comfortable with, so meet people and get to know them. You'll find the connection is even more rewarding than the sex.",0,2024-10-22 13:18:48

You know not having money is such a horrible pain, I want to kill myself. They had a BIG legal problem and it was solved, giving ALLLL the fucking money but it was solved.

I am a failure as an adult, I don't like going to college and I don't even want to work. What's more, I never seriously wanted to be an adult. This being one is a big fucking responsibility and I don't want it at all.

I honestly wish with all my fucking heart that I had DIE in one of my several suicide attempts. I can't take this life anymore. I've had enough.

I think the best way to put it, is his love, his validation, was like an addiction. I felt *so* damn good when he treated me good, when he reassured me, which he would often do even after or during my bad moments.

And, when I would get intoxicated, he would be there to hold me, tell me how much he loved me, no matter how cold, distant, cruel I was while under the influence.

I lost my virginity at 31. Then I met another girl a couple years later. We see each other sometimes but mainly what I'm trying to say is, what you think matters so much, doesn't matter at all. Upon having sex the first time then more times to follow, you'll realize it's not worth living and dying for. Pussy is aight. The girl is waaaay more important, but even then, eventually girls are a headache lol. 

Start slow. Start by talking to girls and meeting people. Each time you put yourself out there, you'll get farther. Asking a girl out on a date and getting rejected is the best thing you can do for yourself. It's more valuable than getting accepted. Talk to people at work and school. Make a dying profile and talk. To people and meet people. Get used to it. Learn to like the connection. It's not about sex. It's about the person you're talking to. Girls love that but don't love guys that aggressively chase tail.

Learn to sit comfortably in a room with people and feel like you belong there. Remember, we are primates in a society and You are one of them, and you belong in this society with your fellow monkeys. You're one of us and we're all the same as you. Meet people and make friends.

Sex comes easier when you SEE people. It's a connection thing more than a sex thing. Girls want to have sex with someone they feel comfortable with, so meet people and get to know them. You'll find the connection is even more rewarding than the sex.",0,2024-10-22 13:18:48

They know you want to fuck when you say spoon, but this is a way of bringing it in milder). If they respond then ask them if they’re good at spooning? If they respond then ask them if they give head? If they respond to this then they’re game. Tell them to come over to yours and then smash them. Do not tell them you’re a virgin they don’t need to know that",-1,2024-10-22 03:20:57

You can meet them randomly just by going out in the community and interacting. In your 20s, taking community college courses puts you on campus where a significant portion of people will be women also in their 20s or a few years off younger or older. Depending on your area, there may be other community events like concerts, festivals, farmers markets, and other classes put on by private businesses like fitness, arts, &c. You can volunteer at an animal shelter, homeless shelter, library, fire department or various other places or with organizations such as disaster relief preparedness (FEMA, OES)

Pretty much all of these options not only provide opportunities to meet women but also non-romantic interest type interactions as well as self-development and/or enriching your life.",1,2024-10-22 17:23:44

Even if I had a healthy family, I would still cause them problems because my mental health is not only affected by my shitty family; today my family has another new very big debt, at least for us who are a family that over the years has been surviving with the money they have. You know not having money is such a horrible pain, I want to kill myself. They had a BIG legal problem and it was solved, giving ALLLL the fucking money but it was solved.

I am a failure as an adult, I don't like going to college and I don't even want to work. What's more, I never seriously wanted to be an adult. This being one is a big fucking responsibility and I don't want it at all. A few days ago I vented on another subreddit and someone made fun of me, it didn't affect me THAT much because I come from an overly abusive family however I got to thinking and he's right.

I honestly wish with all my fucking heart that I had DIE in one of my several suicide attempts. I can't take this life anymore. I've had enough. I don't have my pills to overdose, I'm a fucking fag to cut myself, I'm suicidal and I don't want to be alive even if they ""fix"" my life.
